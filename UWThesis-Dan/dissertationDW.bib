	abstract     = {Variable-gear-ratio steering is an advanced feature in automotive vehicles. As the name suggest, it changes the steering gear ratio depending on the speed of the vehicle. This feature can simplify steering for the driver, which leads to various advantages, such as improved vehicle comfort, stability, and safety. One serious problem, however, is that the variable-gear-ratio system generates unnatural torque to the driver whenever the variable-gear-ratio control is activated. Such unnatural torque includes both low-frequency and steering-speed-dependent components. This paper proposes a control method to cancel this unnatural torque. We address the problem by using a tire sensor and a set of feedback and feedforward algorithms. Effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified using a hardware-in-the-loop experimental setup. Stability and robustness under model uncertainties are evaluated.},

This requirement sets a number of interesting challenges from the viewpoint of sensing, actuation, and control algorithms. This paper considers the control aspect for precision positioning. In motion control systems at nano/micro levels, it has been noted that the control algorithm should be customized as much as possible to the spectrum of disturbances. We will examine how prior knowledge about the disturbance spectrum should be utilized in the design of control algorithms and what are advantages of such prior knowledge. The algorithms will be evaluated on a simulated hard disk drive (HDD) benchmark problem and a laboratory setup for a wafer scanner that is equipped with a laser interferometer for position measurement.},

In this paper, we discuss a feedback loop-shaping approach to address such a class of control problem. An integration of (inverse) system models is proposed to bring enhanced high-gain control at the required local frequency regions. We show that such servo enhancement can be effectively achieved if good model information is available at the disturbance frequencies, and that a rich class of design tools can be integrated for the controller formulation. The proposed algorithm is verified in simulation and experiments on vibration rejection in hard disk drives and an electrical power steering system in automotive vehicles.},

We show the construction of inverse-model-based controller parameterization and discuss its benefits in decoupled design, algorithm tuning, and parameter adaptation. Also studied are the formulation of recursive least squares and output-error-based adaptation algorithms, as well as their corresponding scopes of applications.

Such design considerations are motivated by a large class of practical control problems such as vibration rejection, active noise control, and periodical reference tracking; as well as recent novel challenges that demand new design in the servo technologies. A pseudo Youla--Kucera parameterization scheme is proposed using the inverse system model to bring enhanced control at selected local frequency regions. Design methodologies are created to control the waterbed amplifications that come from the fundamental limitations of feedback control. Finally, simulation and experimental verification are conducted in precision control and semiconductor manufacturing.},

	abstract     = {In repetitive control (RC), the enhanced servo performance at the fundamental frequency and its higher order harmonics is usually followed by undesired error amplifications at other frequencies. In this paper, we discuss a new structural configuration of the internal model in RC, wherein designers have more flexibility in the repetitive loop-shaping design, and the amplification of nonrepetitive errors can be largely reduced. Compared to conventional RC, the proposed scheme is especially advantageous when the repetitive task is subject to large amounts of nonperiodic disturbances. An additional benefit is that the transient response of this plug-in RC can be easily controlled, leading to an accelerated transient with reduced overshoots. Verification of the algorithm is provided by simulation of a benchmark regulation problem in hard disk drives, and by tracking-control experiments on a laboratory testbed of an industrial wafer scanner.},

For example, composition estimates in a distillation column are available at a much slower rate than flow, temperature and pressure measurements. Multirate systems pose a challenging problem due to several reasons such as increased complexity design, time-varying nature, etc. Systems consisting of fast-rate control moves and slow-sampled outputs are a common scenario in chemical processes and of practical interest. Traditionally, inferential techniques based on secondary measurements have been used to design the fast-rate input moves. Lifting techniques conveniently transform multirate systems to single-rate lifted systems with increased dimensionality. Controllers designed using lifting techniques require that certain causality constraints are satisfied. We show firstly, that intersample ripples can arise in the closed-loop output of a multirate system as a result of non-uniform gains of the discrete lifted system and inverse lifting. Secondly, we present conditions on the controller gains to avoid intersample ripples.},

The technique has been extensively studied in the timedomain and has been shown to lead to a range of perceived benefits including high gain and phase margins. However, in view of the periodic nature of the feedback, we argue that it is more natural to adopt an alternative viewpoint in the frequency domain. We show that, within this framework, the action of the periodic controller can be viewed as a form of amplitude modulation (as in communication systems). This gives new theoretical insights into the method, including a clearer understanding of the action of the controller and a complete characterisation of the frequency content of the input and output signals.},

However, such a control system can only avoid instability and cannot suppress disturbances above the Nyquist frequency. To overcome this problem, a control system design method that suppresses disturbances beyond the Nyquist frequency is proposed. This method uses frequency responses of a controlled object and a digital controller to calculate the gain of the sensitivity function in a sampled-data system without requiring complex calculations involving matrices, and realizes a stable resonant filter that decreases the gain of the sensitivity function above the Nyquist frequency. Significant suppression of the vibrations caused by the disturbances beyond the Nyquist frequency is demonstrated by implementing this method in the head-positioning system of a hard disk drive.},

Due to its digital implementation, discrete time ILC approaches do not guarantee good intersample behavior. In fact, common discrete time ILC approaches may deteriorate the intersample behavior, thereby reducing the performance of the sampled-data system. In this paper, a generally applicable multirate ILC approach is presented that enables to balance the at-sample performance and the intersample behavior. Furthermore, key theoretical issues regarding multirate systems are addressed, including the time-varying nature of the multirate ILC setup. The proposed multirate ILC approach is shown to outperform discrete time ILC in realistic simulation examples.},

One is based on the so-called lifting, and the other based on an interpretation of steady-state response in terms of impulse modulation. This paper proves the equivalence of these two notions; in particular, it establishes a more direct link of the second approach to the H��? norm, and also provides the first approach with a natural interpretation of steady-state response as an infinite sum of sinusoidal signals. This study also leads to a comprehensive account of impulse modulation from the lifting viewpoint.}

Despite persistent and painstaking efforts, however, no satisfactory, comprehensive, practicable friction model that captures all of the experimentally observed aspects of friction force dynamics in one formulation is available. Friction comprises multiscale processes requiring multiscale theories. This article presents an example of comprehensive model building, which, starting from the generic mechanisms behind friction, leads to the construction of a model that explains observed macroscopic friction behavior. Effective physics-based models at multiple scales can facilitate future work on the inter-relationships among models by furthering the understanding of emergent, collective frictional properties. Moreover, predictive physical models facilitate the derivation of simple models for control purposes. An example is the generalized Maxwell-slip (GMS) model, which is discussed in this article. Considering friction as a mechanical system, a close examination of the sliding process reveals two friction regimes, namely, the presliding regime and the gross sliding regime. In the presliding regime the adhesive forces owing to asperity contacts are dominant, and thus the friction force is primarily a function of displacement rather than velocity. The reason for this behavior is that the asperity junctions deform elastoplastically, thus behaving as nonlinear hysteretic springs.},

The read/write head is positioned through a voice coil motor (VCM) actuator to which the heads are attached using a thin stainless steel suspension. The servomechanism is expected to move the read/write head from one track to another in minimum time (track-seek mode) and regulate head position precisely on the center of the track during track-following mode. Near time-optimal control is widely used for the seek mode, while linear mode such as proportional-integral differential (PID) plus loop-shaping compensation is used for track following. An alternative to the servomechanism is a lightweight, secondary-stage actuator placed close to the point of control. For small step commands, the dual-stage set-up significantly performs better than a single-stage actuator in regulating the read/write head position. Maneuvers for large step commands are dominated by the VCM's response where the secondary stage provides negligible improvement.},

The algorithm is of recursive prediction error (RPE) form and uses a special constrained model of infinite impulse response (IIR) with a minimal number of parameters. The convergent filter is characterized by highly narrow bandwidth and uniform notches of desired shape. For sufficiently large data sets, the variances of the sine wave frequency estimates are of the same order of magnitude as the Cramer-Rao bound. Results from simulations illustrate the performance of the algorithm under a wide range of conditions.}

The milliactuator comprises a pair of piezo-elements driving a relatively thick loadbeam that is partially etched in selected areas to form a honeycomb like structure. Partial etching allows more freedom in optimizing mass and stiffness to enhance the milliactuator dynamics. For a 18 mm (swage to dimple) milliactuator head gimbal assembly (HGA) with load/unload tab, we were able to achieve a first torsion frequency (T1) of 6 kHz. In a prototype drive populated with milliactuators, a new dual stage servo algorithm resulted in 60\% higher bandwidth (0 dB open-loop crossover) compared to without the milliactuator. Further modifications to the milliactuator along with improvements in sampling rate and computational time could allow up to 100\% higher servo bandwidth. The benefits and limitations of milliactuators are also discussed. The milliactuator provides a low cost, enhanced performance solution for high track densities},

	abstract     = {The best way to enhance the input/output (I/O) performance of a hard disk drive is by increasing the spindle speed. Therefore, the effect of windage vibrations caused by the airflow increases as the spindle speed increases. The servo bandwidth is limited by the primary resonant frequency of the mechanical system. However, the frequencies of the windage vibrations are higher than the primary resonant frequency. Accordingly, these frequencies are also above the servo bandwidth and are too high to be controlled by a conventional control system. In response to this problem, we have developed two methods for designing a servo control system that can suppress the windage vibrations. One method uses a stable mechanical resonant mode, and the other uses a stable resonant mode created by a digital filter. By using these methods, the head-positioning system can control the vibrations above the frequency of the primary resonant mode and the servo bandwidth. Application of these methods to actual hard disk drives showed that they can greatly decrease the windage vibrations, in which the peak frequency is about six times the open-loop gain 0-dB crossover frequency.},

The main tool is a lifting technique which provides a strong correspondence between continuous-time periodic systems and certain types of discrete-time time-invariant systems with infinite-dimensional input and output spaces. Despite the infinite dimensionality of the input and output spaces, a lifted system has a finite-dimensional state space if the original system does. This fact permits rather constructive methods for analyzing these systems. As a demonstration of the utility of this framework, the authors use it to describe the continuous-time (i.e., intersample) behavior of sampled-data systems, and to obtain a complete solution to the problem of parameterizing all controllers that constrain the <e1>L</e1><sup>2 </sup>-induced norm of a sampled-data system to within a certain bound},

As in Jayasuria and Walgama (1993), the concept of orthogonality and the Diophantine equation are used to construct a prefilter with specified preview information. For the purposes of the paper, only the zero preview case is considered. We exploit the nonuniqueness of the Diophantine equation solution to construct a prefilter that is optimal in a certain sense},

Some of these studies however, have utilized conventional processors to obtain the EMG amplitudes. Recent advances (multiple channel combination and whitening) have demonstrated significant improvement in EMG amplitude estimation accuracy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of these EMG amplitude advances into EMG-torque estimation. EMG from biceps/triceps muscles and torque about the elbow joint were collected from fifteen subjects producing constant-posture, nonfatiguing, force-varying contractions. EMG amplitudes were obtained using processors with and without the advances, and then they were related to torque using a linear FIR model. Results demonstrated that both whitening and multiple-channel combination reduced EMG-torque errors and their combination provided an additive benefit Specifically, the EMG-torque prediction errors were reduced to an average of 8\% of maximum voluntary contraction of flexion (MVC<sub>F</sub>) when incorporating a four-channel, whitened processor.},

The structure of the algorithm is reminiscent of a phase-locked loop, although significant differences can be observed. The performance of the estimator is analyzed, and useful design guidelines are provided. A version of the algorithm is presented that combines different components of the signal and/or signals from multiple sensors in order to estimate the fundamental frequency. In this manner, the algorithm is able to maintain tracking of the fundamental frequency despite changes in signal characteristics. The results are verified in simulations and the algorithms are found to be simple and effective for estimation and tracking of time-varying parameters. Experimental results are reported where periodic signals are collected from an active noise control testbed.},

In this paper, the generalized disturbance compensation framework, named the robust internal-loop compensator (RIC) is introduced and an advanced design method of a DOB is proposed based on the RIC. The mixed sensitivity optimization problem, which is the main issue of DOB design, is also solved through the parametrization of the DOB in the RIC framework. Differently from conventional methods, the Q-filter is separated from the mixed sensitivity optimization problem and a systematic design law for the DOB is proposed. This guarantees the robustness and optimality of the DOB and enables the design for unstable plants.},

	year         = 2001,
	abstract     = {This dissertation is concerned with the motion control of Indirect-Drive (ID) robots with Harmonic Drives (HD). Modelling, analysis, simulations, and experiments are conducted for a test bed consisting of a single-joint ID unit with a HD. While ID units with HD possess advantages such as the ability to use small actuators to drive large payloads, they introduce several issues that must be properly addressed in the design of motion control systems. The issues include the nonlinear joint flexibility and nonlinear friction introduced by the HD mechanism, and the fact that the HD unit has a torque limit which must not be exceeded. In addition to these issues, actuator saturation is also considered. In this dissertation, two approaches are explored to address these issues. The first is a practical approach where the issues are addressed almost independently of one another. For friction compensation, Coulomb friction is assumed to be the dominant HD nonlinear friction. Since compensation of Coulomb friction requires knowledge of motor velocity, a Lyapunov-based tuning guideline to estimate motor velocity is derived. Joint flexibility and HD torque limit issues are coupled. When joint vibration causes the HD torque limit to be exceeded, a virtual actuator saturation limit may need to be imposed. Vibration attenuation can make this virtual actuator saturation limit less restrictive. It is proposed to feed back the derivative of joint torque to attenuate joint vibration. This method is shown to be robust with respect to plant parameter uncertainties. The nonlinear joint flexibility can be characterized as a hardening spring. As a result, the pole and zero locations of the linearized model may vary under different operating conditions. This variation can be reduced when the derivative of joint torque is used for feedback. Having reduced some of the nonlinear effects, a tracking controller can be designed to achieve the tracking objective. To avoid a conservative tracking controller design with respect to the actual and virtual saturation limits, a compensation method called Linear Conditioning (LC) is used to address saturation. The second approach is an a priori saturation compensation based on an extension of Artstein's theorem. There are two possible cases. The first is when the actuator cannot make the HD torque to exceed its limit. In this case, the extension of Artstein's theorem can be directly applied to the whole system. The second case, which is encountered in the experimental setup, is when the actuator can make the HD torque to exceed its limit. To deal with the second case, the extension of Artstein's theorem is applied to a part of the system. This determines the joint torque trajectory such that motion tracking is achieved while at the same time, the HD torque limit is not exceeded. Using backstepping, the required actuator torque is computed such that the joint torque follows this joint torque trajectory. To provide robustness with respect to plant parameter uncertainties, nonlinear damping is introduced.},

Tendon actuation leads to compression of the manipulator, extension of the actuators, and is limited by the practical constraint that tendons cannot support compression. In light of these observations, we present a new linear model for transforming desired beam configuration to tendon displacements and <i>vice</i> <i>versa</i>. We begin from first principles in solid mechanics by analyzing the effects of geometrically nonlinear tendon loads. These loads act both distally at the termination point and proximally along the conduit contact interface. The resulting model simplifies to a linear system including only the bending and axial modes of the manipulator as well as the actuator compliance. The model is then manipulated to form a concise mapping from beam configuration-space parameters to <i>n</i> redundant tendon displacements via the internal loads and strains experienced by the system. We demonstrate the utility of this model by implementing an optimal feasible controller. The controller regulates axial strain to a constant value while guaranteeing positive tendon forces and minimizing their magnitudes over a range of articulations. The mechanics-based model from this study provides insight as well as performance gains for this increasingly ubiquitous class of manipulators.},

Specifically, design of a digital notch filter is accomplished through formulation of a regression equation for application to sampled input and output values from the filter. After first expressing the desired transfer function in the continous domain, the equation is developed using sampled data theory relationships. Although the techniques are applied to a specific type of filter, they are general in nature. The problem considered involves attenuation of a particular frequency and those in its immediate vicinity while leaving other even slightly distant frequencies relatively unattenuated. An additional requirement calls for tracking and attenuating an input whose frequency is time-variable. In particular, a linearly (with respect to time) variable frequency is considered and discussed. Testing and evaluation were performed through simulation on a general purpose digital computer. Results obtaied are described.},

Based on a biomechanical analysis of the foot anatomy and joint kinematics, a sensory system is designed for detecting pressure variations on selected areas of the insole, obtained from four different foot movements that can be purposively controlled by the person. A prototype is developed that integrates four sensitive areas, battery, and electronics into a wearable insole; electronics are used for data acquisition and wireless transmission, in order to have a stand-alone device. The prototype foot interface is experimentally tested in the control of a prosthetic hand, as a model of a typical device that can be effectively operated by foot movements. Experimental trials were conducted with ten able-bodied subjects and the results confirmed the usability and effectiveness of the foot interface in terms of correct and prompt transmission of the user's intention to the controlled device. Comparative experimental trials were performed with electromyography (EMG)-based control of the same prosthesis, which represents the most advanced interface currently available in clinical implants for amputees. The comparative results showed a significant decrease in required adaptation and learning from the user's side},

	abstract     = {We carried out a global survey of all major types of transposable elements in Silene latifolia, a model species with sex chromosomes that are in the early stages of their evolution. A shotgun genomic library was screened with genomic DNA to isolate and characterize the most abundant elements. We found that the most common types of elements were the subtelomeric tandem repeat X-43.1 and Gypsy retrotransposons, followed by Copia retrotransposons and LINE non-LTR elements. SINE elements and DNA transposons were less abundant. We also amplified transposable elements with degenerate primers and used them to screen the library. The localization of elements by FISH revealed that most of the Copia elements were accumulated on the Y chromosome. Surprisingly, one type of Gypsy element, which was similar to Ogre elements known from legumes, was almost absent on the Y chromosome but otherwise uniformly distributed on all chromosomes. Other types of elements were ubiquitous on all chromosomes. Moreover, we isolated and characterized two new tandem repeats. One of them, STAR-C, was localized at the centromeres of all chromosomes except the Y chromosome, where it was present on the p-arm. Its variant, STAR-Y, carrying a small deletion, was specifically localized on the q-arm of the Y chromosome. The second tandem repeat, TR1, co-localized with the 45S rDNA cluster in the subtelomeres of five pairs of autosomes. FISH analysis of other Silene species revealed that some elements (e.g., Ogre-like elements) are confined to the section Elisanthe while others (e.g. Copia or Athila-like elements) are present also in more distant species. Similarly, the centromeric satellite STAR-C was conserved in the genus Silene whereas the subtelomeric satellite X-43.1 was specific for Elisanthe section. Altogether, our data provide an overview of the repetitive sequences in Silene latifolia and revealed that genomic distribution and evolutionary dynamics differ among various repetitive elements. The unique pattern of repeat distribution is found on the Y chromosome, where some elements are accumulated while other elements are conspicuously absent, which probably reflects different forces shaping the Y chromosome.},

It is not necessary to solve any algebraic Riccati equations and linear matrix inequalities. The algorithm constructs an online repeatable run-out estimator to extract NRRO components for gradient estimates, thereby preventing the controller parameters from being trapped in a local minima.

When compared with the conventional motion system, this new structure has the advantage that the compensators have a simpler design process than conventional ones and so does its stability analysis. The proposed compensators (or controllers) are evaluated and compared experimentally with a traditional controller on a microcomputer controlled dual-axis positioning system. The experimental results show that the new hybrid structure reduces remarkably the tracking error and contour error. In addition, this new controller can be implemented easily on a majority of motion systems in use today via reprogramming the reference position command subroutine.},

This paper summarizes the far-field and mid-field accomplishments, and reports on the status of recent efforts in obstacle detection and avoidance development. Obstacle detection is based primarily on passive imaging sensors for the desirable properties of covertness and wide field of view, although active sensors are included in the structure to provide the needed high resolution for thin-wire detection.

The tradeoff between stability margin loss and the strength of vibration suppression is a common problem in torsional system control. By introducing fractional order control (FOC) approach, control system can be designed more straightforwardly since control system's frequency responses can be altered between integer order control (IOC) system's continuously, while less control parameters are needed to be decided. Design process and experimental results demonstrate that an "EASY \& STRAIGHTFORWARD DESIGN" can be achieved by introducing FOC control design concept. For implementation of the fractional order Q-filter, broken-line approximation method is applied. Even the realization issues for fractional order controllers are somewhat problematic. Experiment results show that the controllers can actually be realized quite acceptably.},

	abstract     = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: In patients with chronic hepatitis C who failed to respond to standard therapy, high-dose pegylated interferon (IFN)-$\alpha$ and/or ribavirin could induce a stronger antiviral response and prevent treatment failure and HCV resistance when combined with direct-acting antivirals. The influence of genetic determinants in this context remains unknown. METHODS: Eighty-three patients infected with HCV genotype 1 who were nonresponsive to standard therapy received pegylated IFN-$\alpha$2a (360 $\mu$g once per week or 180 $\mu$g twice per week) with ribavirin (1.0-1.2 or 1.2-1.6 g/d) for up to 72 weeks. Virological responses were assessed at different time points, and the influence of the IL-28B genotype was studied. RESULTS: At weeks 12 and 24, respectively, 47 (56.6\%) and 50 (60.2\%) patients achieved a ≥2-Log(10) decrease of HCV RNA levels; 8 (9.6\%) and 21 (25.3\%) patients had undetectable HCV RNA after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, respectively. Patients with a CT IL-28B genotype responded significantly better and earlier than those with a TT genotype. In multivariate analysis, the IL-28B genotype was an independent predictor of the virological responses at weeks 4, 12, and 24. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose pegylated IFN-$\alpha$ with standard or high doses of ribavirin induces a potent antiviral response in a substantial number of patients who did not respond to standard therapy. The IL-28B genotype is an independent predictor of the antiviral response. High-dose pegylated IFN-$\alpha$ in combination with ribavirin and protease inhibitors appears as an attractive option for future study in this population.},

The mixed sensitivity optimization problem, which is the main issue of DOB design, is also solved through the parametrization of the DOB in the RIC framework. Differently from conventional methods, the Q-filter is separated from the mixed sensitivity optimization problem and a systematic design law for the DOB is proposed.

Most studies have used conventional EMG amplitude (EMGamp) processing, such as rectification followed by low-pass filtering, to pre-process the EMG before relating it to torque. Recently, advanced EMGamp processors that incorporate signal whitening and multiple-channel combination have been shown to significantly improve EMGamp processing. In this study, we compared the performance of EMGamp-torque estimators with and without these advanced EMGamp processors. Fifteen subjects produced constant-posture, non-fatiguing, force-varying contractions about the elbow while torque and biceps/triceps EMG were recorded. EMGamp was related to torque using a linear FIR model. Both whitening and multiple-channel combination reduced EMG-torque errors and their combination provided an additive benefit. Using a 15th-order linear FIR model, EMG-torque errors with a four-channel, whitened processor averaged 7.3\% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) (or 78\% of variance accounted for). By comparison, the equivalent single-channel, unwhitened (conventional) processor produced an average error of 9.9\% of MVC (variance accounted for of 55\%). In addition, the study describes the occurrence of spurious peaks in estimated torque when the torque model is created from data with a sampling rate well above the bandwidth of the torque. This problem occurs when the torque data are sampled at the same rate as the EMG data. The problem is corrected by decimating the EMGamp prior to relating it to joint torque, in our case to an effective sampling rate of 40.96燞z.},

LQG/LTR is interpreted as the solution of a specific weighted H<sup>2</sup>-tradeoff between transfer functions in the frequency domain. Properties of this solution are examined for both minimum-phase and nonminimum-phase systems. This leads to a formal weight augmentation procedure for the minimum-phase case which permits essentially arbitrary specification of system sensitivity functions in terms of the weights. While such arbitrary specifications are not possible for nonminimum-phase problems, a direct relationship between weights and sensitivities is developed for nonminimum-phase SISO and certain nonminimum-phase MIMO cases which guides the weight selection process.},

While the original control variable steers the system output along the path, the path parameter [theta] is used as an additional control to stabilize zero dynamics with a feedback law which is nonlinear due to the path constraint. A sufficient condition for solvability of the path-following problem is given in terms of the geometric properties of the path. When this condition is satisfied, an arbitrary small norm of path-following error can be achieved, thus avoiding performance limitations of the standard reference tracking problem imposed by unstable zero dynamics.},

This article presents a dual-stage control design using a peak filter to deal with the midfrequency narrow-band disturbances caused by disk flutter or windage. The technique of initializing the states of the peak filter is proposed to preserve the smoothness of transient response when the dual-stage servo loop is switched on from track-seeking to track-following. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed dual-stage control scheme could effectively suppress the midfrequency disturbance without compromising the settling performance. This method would enhance the disturbance attenuation of the dual-stage servo system for higher track density in HDDs.},

Normally, these parameters are determined from experiments with arbitrarily chosen periods of macromolecule and buffer injections, and varying macromolecule concentrations. Since the choice of these variables is arbitrary, such experiments may not provide the required confidence in identified kinetic parameters expressed in terms of standard errors. In this work, an iterative optimization approach is used to determine the above-mentioned variables so as to reduce the experimentation time, while treating the required standard errors as constraints. It is shown using multiple experimental and simulated data that the desired confidence can be reached with much shorter experiments than those generally performed by biosensor users.},

The motivation for applying power spectrum estimation methods to SAR imaging is to improve resolution, remove sidelobe artifacts, and reduce speckle compared to what is possible with conventional Fourier transform SAR imaging techniques. This paper makes two principal contributions to the field of adaptive SAR imaging. First, it is a comprehensive comparison of 2D spectral estimation methods for SAR imaging. It provides a synopsis of the algorithms available, discusses their relative merits for SAR imaging, and illustrates their performance on simulated and collected SAR imagery. Some of the algorithms presented or their derivations are new, as are some of the insights into or analyses of the algorithms. Second, this work develops multichannel variants of four related algorithms, minimum variance method (MVM), reduced-rank MVM (RRMVM), adaptive sidelobe reduction (ASR) and space variant apodization (SVA) to estimate both reflectivity intensity and interferometric height from polarimetric displaced-aperture interferometric data. All of these interferometric variants are new. In the interferometric contest, adaptive spectral estimation can improve the height estimates through a combination of adaptive nulling and averaging. Examples illustrate that MVM, ASR, and SVA offer significant advantages over Fourier methods for estimating both scattering intensity and interferometric height, and allow empirical comparison of the accuracies of Fourier, MVM, ASR, and SVA interferometric height estimates.},

In the case of minimum phase systems, the trajectory produced agrees with that generated by Hirschorn's inverse dynamic system; however, the preimage trajectory is noncausal (rather than unstable) in the nonminimum phase case. In addition, the analysis leads to a simple geometric connection between the unstable manifold of the system zero dynamics and noncausality in the nonminimum phase case. With the addition of stabilizing feedback to the preimage trajectory, asymptotically exact output tracking is achieved. Tracking is demonstrated with a numerical example and compared to the well-known Byrnes-Isidori regulator. Rather than solving a partial differential equation to construct a regulator, the inverse is calculated using a Picard-like interaction. When preactuation is not possible, noncausal inverse trajectories can be truncated resulting in the tracking-error transients found in other control schemes},

The worst-case performance is compared for two cases: (1) with the use of feedback alone and (2) with the addition of the feedforward input. It is shown that inversion-based feedforward controllers can lead to performance improvements at frequencies w where the uncertainty \&Delta; (jw) in the nominal plant is smaller than the size of the nominal plant G<sub>0</sub>(jw) divided by its condition number K<sub>G0</sub> (jw), i.e., ||\&Delta;(jw)||<sub>2</sub> < ||G<sub>0</sub>(jw) ||<sub>2</sub>/k<sub>G0</sub> (jw).

	abstract     = {In this dissertation, we investigate the design of digital controllers for dual actuator hard disk drive systems. The dual actuator disk drive system consists of a coarse actuator (voice coil motor, VCM) and a fine actuator (piezoelectric transducer, PZT). Three aspects of dual actuator disk servo are studied: track following control, track settling and seeking control, and multi-rate control for computational saving. First, the track following problem is addressed for dual actuator disk drive systems. We present the design of digital controllers for dual actuator servo systems and the analysis of their robust stability and performance. The design is divided into two steps. In the first step, the stability of the coarse actuator loop is an important consideration. In the second step, the fine actuator loop is designed by loop shaping for superior performance of the overall system. Robustness is studied by $\mu$-analysis after the closed loop system is augmented with various weightings. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. Next, the track settling and seeking control is presented for the dual actuator hard disk drive system. The control design method is called the dual actuator reference trajectory re-design (RTRD). In RTRD, the original minimum jerk reference trajectory for VCM and another "redesigned" minimum jerk reference trajectory are combined to determine the reference trajectory for PZT for faster settling of the recording head on the target track. The RTRD is divided into three steps. In the first step, the coarse actuator controller is designed to be stable and achieve the basic performance. In the second step, the fine actuator controller is designed for superior performance of the overall system. Finally the reference signals are generated for both VCM and PZT actuators. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Finally, multi-rate control is studied for computation saving. The dual actuator disk drive system involves two actuators, i.e. VCM and PZT, with different bandwidths, and the two feedback loops are closed at different rates: a fast rate for a high bandwidth PZT loop and a slow rate for a low bandwidth VCM loop. The slow rate VCM controller is further decomposed and interlaced so that computational saving by multi-rate control may be distributed uniformly at all fast rate sampling instances. The experimental results show that the multi-rate implementations achieve regulation performance of the position error signal at about the same level as the single-rate implementation while realizing significant computational saving.},

The read/write head is positioned through a voice coil motor {(VCM)} actuator to which the heads are attached using a thin stainless steel suspension. The servomechanism is expected to move the read/write head from one track to another in minimum time (track-seek mode) and regulate head position precisely on the center of the track during track-following mode. Near time-optimal control is widely used for the seek mode, while linear mode such as proportional-integral differential {(PID)} plus loop-shaping compensation is used for track following. An alternative to the servomechanism is a lightweight, secondary-stage actuator placed close to the point of control. For small step commands, the dual-stage set-up significantly performs better than a single-stage actuator in regulating the read/write head position. Maneuvers for large step commands are dominated by the {VCM's} response where the secondary stage provides negligible improvement.},

In such situations, existing disturbance observer design techniques encounter difficulties due to bandwidth limitations or relative degree restrictions on disturbance observer filtering. These problems can be avoided by a straightforward inclusion of time delay in the nominal plant model. As a result, the disturbance observer sensitivity function is degraded, but this is offset by the fact that higher bandwidth low pass filtering can be used. Importantly, input-output characteristics of the disturbance observer loop better approximate the nominal plant model, thus improving noise rejection and simplifying the subsequent design of outer loop compensation and feedforward filtering. The technique is applied one axis of a high speed X-Y table. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique},

It is shown that timing jitter can be significantly reduced with loop filter designed with the H<sub>2</sub> method.},

In both cases, the optimization problem is transformed into a quadratic form using an internal model of one part of the physical system under control. The resulting architecture for the feedback controller is known as internal model control (IMC) and is widely used in the H∞ control literature. With this controller architecture, the optimum performance of a multichannel feedback system can be readily calculated using the quadratic optimization techniques already developed in the sampled time domain for multichannel feedforward control. The robustness of the stability of such a feedback controller to changes in the plant response can be separately assessed using a generalization of the complementary sensitivity function, which has a particularly simple form when IMC is used. The stability robustness can be improved by incorporating various forms of effort weighting into the cost function being minimized, some of which are already used for adaptive feedforward controllers. By way of example, the performance is calculated of both feedforward and feedback controllers for the active attenuation of road noise in cars. The variation of performance with loop delay is calculated for both types of control, and it is found that in this example, the potential attenuation is greatest using feedback control but only if the loop delay is less than 1.5 ms},

A disturbance observer and PD compensation was used as a robust feedback controller and a zero-phase error-tracking controller was used as the feedforward controller.This method was applied to an X-Y table, and experimental results demonstrate that this method yields excellent tracking performance and robustness to plant parameter variations.},

For this, a disturbance observer is applied to each joint of an n degrees of freedom manipulator to obtain a simple equivalent robot dynamics (SERD) being represented as an n independent double integrator system. For an arbitrary trajectory generated for a given path in Cartesian space, whenever the saturation of any actuators is met, the desired acceleration of the nominal trajectory in Cartesian space is modified online by using SERD. Also an integral action with respect to the difference between the nominal and the modified trajectories is utilized in nonsaturated region of actuators to reduce the path error. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, numerical simulations and real experiments are performed for two degrees of freedom SCARA type direct-drive arm},

It exploits an underlying rotational invariance among signal subspaces induced by an array of sensors with a translational invariance structure.

In this paper the authors provide a solution to the problem of ensuring a globally convergent estimation. More specifically, they propose a new adaptive notch filter whose dynamic equations exhibit the following remarkable features: 1) all signals are globally bounded and the estimated frequency is asymptotically correct for all initial conditions and all frequency values; 2) the authors obtain a simple tuning procedure for the estimator design parameters, which trades-off the adaptation tracking capabilities with noise sensitivity, ensuring (exponential) stability of the desired orbit; and 3) transient performance is considerably enhanced, even for small or large frequencies, as witnessed by extensive simulations. To reveal some of the stability-instability mechanisms of the existing algorithms and motivate our modifications the authors make appeal to a novel nonlinear (state-dependent) time scaling. The main advantage of working in the new time scale is that they remove the coupling between the parameter update law and the filter itself, decomposing the system into a feedback form where the required modifications to ensure stability become apparent. Even though they limit their attention here to the simplest case of a single constant frequency without noise the algorithm is able to track time-varying frequencies, preserve local stability in the presence of multiple sinusoids, and is robust with respect to noise}

Recently an ANF with global convergence property has been developed for this purpose. There exist some practical applications in which signals are not pure sinusoidal and contain harmonics. Therefore, online frequency estimation of periodic but not necessarily sinusoidal signals espoused by such applications becomes quite important. This note presents an alternative stability analysis for a modified ANF that permits the presence of harmonics in the incoming signal. Also, this stability analysis is simpler and alleviates the problem complexity even in the case of pure sinusoidal signal. Simulation results confirm theoretical issues.}

In the discrete-time setting, this problem plays an important role in digital quantization. Several results are presented. First, we prove that this plant family is robustly SPR if and only if all “corner plants? in the family are SPR. We then show that, if this plant family is robustly SPR, it admits a multiaffine Lyapunov matrix for the Kalman-Yakubovic-Popov (KYP) inequality, i.e., the Lyapunov matrix is multiaffine in the uncertain parameters. This result is useful in robustness analysis of time-varying systems. Finally, we relate the robust SPRness of this plant family to the robust strict bounded realness (SBRness) of a plant family involving the inverse of N(s,qn)D-1 (s,q d). We show that multiaffine Lyapunov matrix for the KYP inequality of the first plant family yields a multiaffine Lyapunov matrix for the bounded real inequality of the second plant family. Finally, the robust SPR problem is considered for a more general plant family with applications in circuits and communication systems},

	abstract     = {Grasp quality measures are important for understanding how to plan for and maintain appropriate and secure grasps for pick and place operations and tool use. Most grasp quality measures assume certain symmetries about the mechanism or the task. For example, contact points may be considered to be independent and identical, or an ellipsoidal measure such as the force manipulability ellipsoid may be used. However, many tasks have strong asymmetries, where wrenches in certain directions dominate. Tendon driven hand designs may also have strong asymmetries, leading to differing abilities to apply contact forces in different directions. This paper begins to explore empirically the validity of some of the symmetry assumptions employed by common grasp quality metrics. We examine the human hand and the shadow robot hand, and find that force abilities vary with finger choice and with location of the contact on the finger for both hands. However, while the human hand shows dramatic changes for different poses due to its asymmetric design, the shadow hand, with a symmetric design shows much smaller changes and resembles the assumption of identical and independent contact points reasonably well. Thus, we suggest that the underlying design of the hand is a very important factor to consider for grasp quality metrics and for grasp planning and control. The specific grasp quality metric we study in this paper also brings together a variety of previous research. We outline a linear programming approach for computing a grasp quality metric that includes tendon force constraints and contact constraints and can handle any task described as a polytope in wrench space},

Due to this inner loop of linear control, a disturbance is strongly suppressed but not completely. Then, the outer loop of sliding mode control eliminates this disturbance suppression error. In this paper, a linear robust-servo design of two-degree-of-freedom control system is shown. Sliding mode control is applied to this system and the disturbance suppression characteristics are discussed.

The advantages of the proposed method are that: (1) the proposed multirate feedforward controller eliminates the notorious unstable zero problem in designing the discrete-time inverse system; (2) the states of the plant match the desired trajectories at every sampling point of reference input; and (3) the proposed controller is completely independent of the feedback characteristics. Thus, highly robust performance is assured by the robust feedback controller. Moreover, by generalizing the relationship between the sampling period of plant output and the control period of plant input, the proposed method can be applied to various systems with hardware restrictions of these periods, which leads to higher performance. Next, it is shown that the structure of the proposed perfect tracking controller is very simple and clear. Illustrative examples of position control using a DC servomotor are presented, and simulations and experiments demonstrate the advantages of this approach},

Thus, it was difficult to apply the conventional adaptive controllers directly to these systems. In this paper, multirate adaptive robust control (MARC) is proposed for these systems. This scheme is developed by the good combination of perfect tracking control (PTC) with multirate feedforward control which has been proposed by the first author and discontinuous projection based adaptive robust control (ARC) which has been proposed by the second author. Although the original PTC can assure perfect tracking only for nominal plant, the proposed MARC can guarantee: 1) perfect tracking for plant with parametric uncertainty and 2) overall stability even if there exist modeling error and disturbance. The proposed scheme is applied to the high-speed position control of a linear motor, and the advantages are demonstrated through experiments.},

In the proposed method, it is assumed that plant is modeled as the rigid-body and primary vibration modes. By using this model, a feedforward PTC is designed with a modified controllable canonical realization in order to control the transient response of position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk of the proposed virtual plant. Simulations and experiments are carried out to show that the proposed system can suppress the primary vibration mode in short-span seeking control. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a benchmark problem of HDD control which is made by a technical committee of IEE of Japan.

These ZPETC's can provide the overall control system with not only the above phase property but also the excellent tracking performance for a desired output and the superior gain property, respectively.

	abstract     = {Spindle cell sarcomas consist of tumors with different biological features, of which distant metastasis is the most ominous sign for a poor prognosis. However, metastasis is difficult to predict on the basis of current histopathological analyses. We have identified actin filament-associated protein 1-like 1 (AFAP1L1) as a candidate for a metastasis-predicting marker from the gene expression profiles of 65 spindle cell sarcomas. A multivariate analysis determined that AFAP1L1 was an independent factor for predicting the occurrence of distant metastasis (P=0.0001), which was further confirmed in another set of 41 tumors by a quantitative mRNA expression analysis. Immunohistochemical staining using paraffin-embedded tumor tissues revealed that the metastasis-free rate was significantly better in tumors negative for AFAP1L1 (P=0.0093 by log-rank test). Knocking down the AFAP1L1 gene in sarcoma cells resulted in inhibition of the cell invasion, and forced expression of AFAP1L1 in immortalized human mesenchymal stem cells induced anchorage-independent growth and increased cell invasiveness with high activity levels of matrix metallopeptidase. Furthermore, tumor growth in vivo was accelerated in AFAP1L1-transduced sarcoma cell lines. These results suggest that AFAP1L1 has a role in the progression of spindle cell sarcomas and is a prognostic biomarker.Oncogene advance online publication, 25 April 2011; doi:10.1038/onc.2011.108.},

The first servo bandwidth limiting mode is the so-called \&ldquo;butterfly mode,\&rdquo; which is the major mode in the head mechanical transfer functions and can not be avoided through mechanical design. A special active damping technique has been developed for rotary actuators of 3-1/2" drives. With an additional sensor on the actuator and an external feedback loop, the butterfly mode can be damped and stiffened while the system stability is maintained. A theoretical system model, based on FEM, modal superposition and feedback control, is developed for analytical prediction of system stability and dynamics. Drive level experiments are conducted on actuators of two different designs, and show that the butterfly mode can be totally damped such that the gain of the head mechanical transfer function is close to 1/s <sup>2</sup>. The end arm mode is also damped by about 8 dB for one actuator design. Servo improvement is also studied. It shows that the butterfly mode notch filter can be removed, and the phase margin can be improved by 7 degrees},

The hybrid electrokinetic technique combines short-range electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis, and long-range AC electrothermal flow to improve its effectiveness. The major technical hurdle of electrode instability for manipulating high conductivity samples is tackled by using a Ti-Au-Ti sandwich electrode and a 3-parallel-electrode configuration is designed for continuous isolation of bacteria. The device operates directly with biological samples including urine and buffy coats. We show that pathogenic bacteria and biowarfare agents can be concentrated for over 3 orders of magnitude using hybrid electrokinetics.},

Modern aerospace vehicles and systems are described by high-order dynamic models which typically include phenomena covering a wide range of characteristic frequencies and instrumentation measurements available at multiple rates. A multirate control structure allows the designer to accommodate multiple information rates and implement required control computations within the finite computational capabilities of an on-board computer. In this paper the historical development, representative design approaches, and example applications of multirate digital control are outlined. A brief survey of traditional design approaches and techniques currently in development is presented. Potential future areas of research and application of multirate control are suggested and discussed.},

It is generally known that higher robustness is achieved by higher bandwidth of the low-pass filter, which is used in the disturbance observer. However, control engineers in practice face problems with realization of the high bandwidth filter. It was considered that the high frequency noise, which is amplified by the time derivative in the observer, causes instability. However, in our paper we show that the vibration and instability of the control system are rather caused by inappropriate sampling time than by the generated noise. We study both the low pass filter and the disturbance observer in discrete time, and give the guidelines to set the filter's cut-off frequency, nominal parameters of the observer, and gain of the speed loop controller, all in relation to the sampling time, to achieve stable and nonvibrational response. Results are verified by simulation and experiments.},

	abstract     = {In this dissertation, multi-rate control is studied for performance enhancement of motion control systems under measurement constraints. A multi-rate feedback/feed-forward control structure is proposed and analyzed. For feedback control systems, multi-rate digital redesign methods are considered from both the analysis and design points of view. In the multi-rate feedback/feed-forward control scheme, the feedback controller is updated at the same rate as the sampling rate of the output measurements. The feedforward controller processes the desired output signal for high accuracy tracking, and its output is updated at a rate N-times faster than the sampling rate of the output measurements. When compared with the single rate feedback/feed-forward control scheme, the proposed scheme has at least two advantages. When the sampling rate of the output measurements is fixed, the plant output remains closer to the desired output by increasing the update rate of the feed-forward control input. In certain cases, the proposed multi-rate scheme can avoid the fundamental problem in the design of feed-forward controllers arising from unstable zeros of the discrete time transfer function model of the system. Digital redesign by multi-rate sampling and high order holds are studied for recovering the performance of the continuous time controller which may be lost by discretization, especially for feedback control systems with large measurement sampling period. The controller output is updated at a frequency N times faster than the measurement sampling frequency, and at the same time the evolution of the error signal between two consecutive sampling instances is estimated by utilizing present and past error measurements. General equations for analyzing such multi-rate control systems are presented. It is shown that multi-rate control and high order holds are useful for recovering the performance of the original continuous time compensator. Also studied is a multi-rate H ∞ optimal digital redesign of continuous time controllers. It focuses on the performance of the closed loop system under digital control. The discrete time controller is obtained through minimization of H ∞ norm of the lifted system. The stability of the closed loop system with the redesigned controller is guaranteed. The proposed approaches are applied to track following control of a hard disk drive (HDD) servo system.},

	abstract     = {In this dissertation a new operator, the d-operator, which combines the two commonly used operators, the shift (q) and the delta ($\delta$) operators, is proposed for modeling discrete-time systems. This provides a new framework in which some inherent problems associated with digital computer controlled systems are dealt with in a systematic way. This results in better control and system identification. A new way of realizing a discrete-time system in state space using the d-operator is proposed. Theoretical analyses of numerical characteristics of the realization are carried out. It is shown that for any given constraint on state space realization dynamic range, the optimized d-realization has lower sensitivity than that of the optimized q- and $\delta$-realizations. It is also shown that an optimal d-realization can always be found to guarantee a lower round-off noise than that of the optimized q- and $\delta$-realizations. These yield better numerical properties of state space realizations of a system which in turn improve the performance. The d-operator is then used in system identification. It is shown that by reparametrizing the transfer function using this operator, a lower condition number for the information matrix in the least squares estimation can be obtained. As a result, more accurate and faster converging parameter identification can be achieved, especially for high order systems with wide bandwidth and when sampling rates are high. The numerical superiority of the d-operator parametrization over the q- and $\delta$-operator parametrizations is demonstrated by simulation results. An optimal hydrid feedforward controller designed using the d-operator is proposed for high speed and high precision digital motion control systems. Uncancellable discrete-time zeros arising from sampling the continuous plant at high rates, which make the mathematical inverse unstable, are handled in a natural way. The controller is optimized to have good performance in both low and high frequency ranges. It is able to handle uncancellable discrete time zeros in the right half plane. The optimizations problem is then generalized to an H$\backslash$sp$\backslash$infty problem. Convex minimizations techniques are used to find the solution to the optimization problem. A model of an NSK high precision X-Y table is used in the simulations. The simulation results have shown that the proposed controller has superior performance over other feedforward control schemes, especially when tracking trajectories with high accelerations. Experiments on a Matsuura MC510V Vertical Machining center have been carried out and good results have been obtained.},

	abstract     = {In many applications of feedback control, phase information is available concerning the plant uncertainty. For example, lightly damped flexible structures with colocated rate sensors and force actuators give rise to positive real transfer functions. Closed-loop stability is thus guaranteed by means of negative feedback with strictly positive real compensators. In this paper, the properties of positive real transfer functions are used to guarantee robust stability in the presence of positive real (but otherwise unknown) plant uncertainty. These results are then used for controller synthesis to address the problem of robust stabilization in the presence of positive real uncertainty. One of the principal motivations for these results is to utilize phase information in guaranteeing robust stability. In this these sense results go beyond the usual limitations the small gain theorem and quadratic Lyapunov functions which may be conservative when phase information is available. The results of this paper are based upon a Riccati equation formulation of the positive real lemma and thus are in the spirit of recent Riccati-based approaches to bounded real (H[infinity]) control.},

In machinery in which it is not the driving force, however, friction is an undesirable parasitic phenomenon, generating heat and wasting energy. Large sums are spent each year on lubricants to eliminate as much friction as possible in mechanical devices. On the other hand, when friction is the source of traction and braking, it is important to keep friction at a high level. To achieve this end, much effort and funding are expended on projects such as improving tires and antilock brakes. The goals of this article are first to review some of the physical characteristics of friction, especially the need for state-space dynamic models; then to describe apparatus for measuring friction effects and to present the results achieved using this apparatus; and, finally, to discuss some of the issues relating to measurement of friction effects.},

Human can appropriately produce muscle contraction torque and control joint viscoelasticity by muscle effort such as co-contraction. Thus, to implement functions equivalent to human muscles using HAL, it is necessary to control viscoelasticity of HAL as well as to produce torque in accordance with operator's intention. Therefore the purpose of this study is to propose a control method of HAL using biological and motion information. In this method, HAL produces torque corresponding to muscle contraction torque by referring to the myoelectricity that is biological information to control operator's muscles. In addition, the viscoelasticities of HAL are adjusted in proportion to operator's viscoelasticity that is estimated from motion information by using an on-line parameter identification method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the method was applied to a swinging motion of a lower leg. When this method was applied, HAL could work like operator's muscles in the swinging motion, and as a consequence, the muscle activities of the operator were reduced. As a result of this experiment, we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Methods are outlined to design a notch filter for a prescribed notch frequency and a prescribed 3-dB rejection bandwidth, along with procedures for postdesign adjustment of these parameters. All two-multiplier, canonic and noncanonic, notch filter configurations are developed using the multiplier extraction approach. These networks are then compared with regard to the effect of internal multiplication roundoff errors. Results of computer simulation of the notch filter configurations are also included.},

The design requirements for a microactuator are investigated. These include high Z-directional stiffness, low in-plane stiffness, high structural aspect ratio, large output force, high area efficiency, low cost, and mass batch production. An area-efficient rotary microactuator design was devised, and microactuators were successfully fabricated using innovative processing technologies. The microactuator has a structural thickness of 40 \&mu;m with a minimum gap/structure width of approximately 2 \&mu;m. Its frequency response was measured and it was determined that it can be modeled as a second-order linear system, up to the 26-kHz frequency range. Moreover, the microactuator will enable the design of a servo system that exceeds a 5-kHz servo bandwidth, which is adequate to achieve a track density of more than 25 kilotrack per inch (kTPI). The microactuator/slider assembly was also tested on a spinning disk, with its position controlled by a PID controller using the magnetic position error signal written on the disk. An accuracy of about 0.05 \&mu;m was observed when the servo controller was turned on. Continuous-time dual-stage servos were designed and simulated using the \&mu;-synthesis technique. A sequentially designed SISO and a MIMO control design method have been shown to be capable of meeting prescribed uncertainty and performance specifications},

The important ingredient is that the gradient of the design criterion is computed from measured closed loop data. The approach is thus not model-based. The scheme converges to a stationary point of the design criterion under the assumption of boundedness of the signals in the loop. From a practical viewpoint, the scheme offers several advantages. It is straightforward to apply. It is possible to control the rate of change of the controller in each iteration. The objective can be manipulated between iterations in order to tighten or loosen performance requirements. Certain frequency regions can be emphasized if desired. This direct optimal tuning algorithm is particularly well suited for the tuning of the basic control loops in the process industry, which are typically PID loops. These primary loops are often very badly tuned, making the application of more advanced (for example, multivariable) techniques rather useless. A first requirement in the successful application of advanced control techniques is that the primary loops be tuned properly. This new technique appears to be a very practical way of doing this, with an almost automatic procedure},

The electronic/magnetic noise that contaminates the PES produces its own nonrepetitive runout (NRRO). Furthermore, this noise can deceive our assessment of NRRO.

The friction compensator is based on the experimental friction model and it compensates for unmodeled nonlinear friction. Stability of the closed-loop is provided by the feedback controller. The robust feedback controller based on the disturbance observer compensates for external disturbances and plant uncertainties. Precise tracking is achieved by the zero phase error tracking controller.

	abstract     = {Online estimation of the frequency of a sinusoidal signal is a classical problem in systems theory that has many practical applications. In this paper the authors provide a solution to the problem of ensuring a globally convergent estimation. More specifically, they propose a new adaptive notch filter whose dynamic equations exhibit the following remarkable features: 1) all signals are globally bounded and the estimated frequency is asymptotically correct for all initial conditions and all frequency values; 2) the authors obtain a simple tuning procedure for the estimator design parameters, which trades-off the adaptation tracking capabilities with noise sensitivity, ensuring (exponential) stability of the desired orbit; and 3) transient performance is considerably enhanced, even for small or large frequencies, as witnessed by extensive simulations. To reveal some of the stability-instability mechanisms of the existing algorithms and motivate our modifications the authors make appeal to a novel nonlinear (state-dependent) time scaling. The main advantage of working in the new time scale is that they remove the coupling between the parameter update law and the filter itself, decomposing the system into a feedback form where the required modifications to ensure stability become apparent. Even though they limit their attention here to the simplest case of a single constant frequency without noise the algorithm is able to track time-varying frequencies, preserve local stability in the presence of multiple sinusoids, and is robust with respect to noise}

A large number of parameters govern the \{LBAM\} process. These parameters are sensitive to the environmental variations, and they also influence each other. This paper introduces the research work in \{RCAM\} on improving the performance of the \{LBAM\} process. Metal powder delivery real-time sensing and control is studied to achieve a controllable powder delivery for fabrication of functionally graded material. A closed-loop control system based on infrared image sensing is built for control of the heat input and size of the molten pool in the \{LBAM\} process. The closed-loop control results show a great improvement in the geometrical accuracy of the built features. A three-dimensional finite element model is also established to explore the thermal behavior of the molten pool in the closed-loop controlled \{LBAM\} process.},

One of the major drawbacks of the conventional disturbance observer design is that the disturbance rejection rate is increased at the cost of increased amplification on high frequency system noise, and consequently, system stability. To improve the disturbance compensation capability without affecting the system stability, a novel disturbance observer design is proposed in this paper. The idea is to replace the constant controller gain in the conventional disturbance observer with a first order filter. Compared with the conventional disturbance observer design, the proposed disturbance observer is shown to decrease the settling time by 40\% and increase high frequency measurement noise attenuation by 10 db, respectively. The proposed design has been implemented on a test stand with a 3.5" hard drive. Both simulation and experimental results have validated the claim},

First, aimed at the choice of cables-driven manners, a cable-driven mechanism that is coupled between elbow and wrist, and between shoulder and elbow is designed. Second, taking the 7-DOF joints such as the shoulder, elbow and wrist as medium, the relationship between the end-effector and driven cables is analyzed, i.e. through considering the relationship among the end-effector's pose and joint angles first for the manipulator, and then considering the relationship among joint angles and corresponding cable lengths, the kinematics of cable-driven manipulator can be solved. Lastly the simulation is realized. The simulation results show that the curves of manipulator's joint angles and cable lengths are very smooth, and the error between actual trajectory and ideal trajectory of the end-effector is very small. These prove that the proposed algorithms are correct, the cable-driven manipulator runs well, and proposed approach can effectively overcome the negative effects from general robot brought by its deadweight.},

We then present a taxonomy of visual servo control systems. The two major classes of systems, position-based and image-based systems, are then discussed in detail. Since any visual servo system must be capable of tracking image features in a sequence of images, we also include an overview of feature-based and correlation-based methods for tracking. We conclude the tutorial with a number of observations on the current directions of the research field of visual servo control},

Noting that the pivot torque bias due to uncertain disturbances and nonlinearities such as pivot friction is approximately the difference between the scaled voice-coil motor (VCM) current and the scaled carriage angular acceleration, a disturbance observer to estimate the bias can be constructed using the above two continuously measured signals. By feeding back the bias estimate into the VCM amplifier, the frequency response from the VCM current to the carriage angular acceleration is linearized to be a constant gain within the observer bandwidth. The proposed cancellation scheme provides wider bandwidth bias rejection and better settling performance than traditional bias compensation schemes. Experiments have confirmed that the cancellation scheme is effective in the frequency range 0-700 Hz},

The controlled plant used here has a mechanical resonance at a higher frequency than the Nyquist frequency, which is the half of a sampling frequency of controllers. As a result, it has been confirmed that type A controllers are robust against aliasing of the mechanical resonance and that type B controllers, which have the same features as conventional digital controllers using analog notch (band-eliminated) filters, attains a wider control bandwidth than that of type A. Although the control system is affected by the resonance aliasing, a type B controller has achieved higher positioning accuracy than that of type A in a benchmark simulation of a hard disk drive with dual-stage servo mechanism.},

A key link between the two is the mediator complex, which consists of a core complex that reversibly associates with the accessory kinase module. We show here that genes activated by Notch signaling at the dorsal-ventral boundary of the Drosophila wing disc fall into three classes that are affected differently by the loss of kinase module subunits. One class requires all four kinase module subunits for activation, while the others require only Med12 and Med13, either for activation or for repression. These distinctions do not result from different requirements for the Notch coactivator Mastermind or the corepressors Hairless and Groucho. We propose that interactions with the kinase module through distinct cofactors allow the DNA-binding protein Suppressor of Hairless to carry out both its activator and repressor functions.

The obtained RRO disturbance data is further used to compensate for the RRO disturbance. The error transfer function (or sensitivity function) can be obtained without any additional instrument, and moreover the estimated RRO disturbance obtained from the proposed method will not be affected by the variation of the actuator model. Furthermore, the proposed method is much easier to be implemented than the fast Fourier transform and inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT/IFFT) method as much less computation is needed. Experimental results show that the servo tracking performance can be significantly improved by using the estimated disturbance to compensate the actual RRO disturbances. Comparative study between the proposed RRO compensation method and the iterative learning control (ILC)-based compensation method has also been performed in this paper.}

The filter zero is designed to minimally degrade the closed-loop system stability and obtain a smooth sensitivity curve around the disturbance frequency. The paper presents a nonlinear optimization procedure for selecting the filter parameters so that the statistical position error is minimized. Experimental results of a piezoelectrically actuated head positioning control system on a spinstand demonstrate that the add-on filter can further reduce the midfrequency nonrepeatable runout of the position error signal by 8\% and preserve the stability margin of the original feedback control system},

The analysis shows that stick-slip motion modeled by the LuGre model is a stiff system with different behavior in the stick and slip modes as well as dramatic transitions between these modes. The dependence of limit cycles on parameters is discussed along with the notion of rate dependence.},

The cable transmission connecting the actuators to the joints remotely, causes a motion coupling problem where the length or tension of the cable is changed due to an unwanted motion interference at joints. To maintain the cable length constant regardless of the rotation of the arm, we used three different schemes such as a motion-decoupled structure for a shoulder joint, a novel motion decoupling mechanism for an elbow joint, and an optimization of the geometric parameters for a wrist joint. Experimental results show that the overall cable length variation at the cable-driven joints is less than 0.01 mm. Therefore, we expect that the suggested decoupling methods could assure a more accurate motion control for a cable-driven servomanipulator.},

To cope with the high-resonant peak of the open loop inverter that may cause instability, a zero-phase-shift notch filter other than the inverse transfer function of the inverter or a conventional second-order filter is incorporated in the controller. The proposed method has good harmonic rejection and large tolerance to parameter variations. To further reduce the steady-state error, a low-pass-filter Q(z) algorithm is applied. The DC bias problem is also taken into consideration and solved with the repetitive controller itself. The method is implemented with a digital signal processor and achieves low THD\% (1.4\%-1.7\%) with nonlinear loads and fast error convergence (3-5 fundamental periods). It proves to be a cost-effective solution for common UPS products where high-quality output voltage is more stressed than fast dynamic response.},

Berkeley, walking at the average speed of 1.3 m/s while carrying a 34 kg (75 lb) payload. Four fundamental technologies associated with the Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX) were tackled during the course of this project. These four core technologies include: the design of the exoskeleton architecture, control schemes, a body local area network (bLAN) to host the control algorithm and an on-board power unit to power the actuators, sensors and the computers. This article gives an overview of one of the control schemes. The analysis here is an extension of the classical definition of the sensitivity function of a system: the ability of a system to reject disturbances or the measure of system robustness. The control algorithm developed here increases the closed loop system sensitivity to its wearer\&\#8217;s forces and torques without any measurement from the wearer (such as force, position, or electromyogram signal). The control method has little robustness to parameter variations and therefore requires a relatively good dynamic model of the system. The tradeoffs between having sensors to measure human variables and the lack of robustness to parameter variation are described.},

	abstract     = {This paper presents a servo-mechanically combined strategy to reduce the position error signal (PES) in high-track density magnetic disk drives. In this strategy, a special head-gimbal assembly (HGA) is designed so that it can move not only vertically to the disk but also across the data tracks. It is shown that such HGAs can reduce the track misregistration (TMR) due to disk vibration, by allowing the head to move in such a way that will compensate the off-track caused by disk bending. A further reduction in the final PES is then attempted by redesigning the servo loop shape taking the reduced disk-mode disturbance into consideration. The well-known random neighborhood search method is applied to find a set of servo gains that best approximates a desired loop shape determined based on empirical knowledge. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed strategy is demonstrated experimentally by using actual sample drives.},

The overall model (PWM+PMLM) inevitably inherits uncertainties in the face of load changes, system parameter perturbation, noise, and inherent system nonlinearities, etc., all of which constitute disturbances to the control system that will adversely affect the precision and accuracy. We propose a robust control scheme employing a disturbance observer to address the sensitivity of the control performance to the disturbances.

Among them, the disturbance observer (DOB) has been widely used because it is easy to apply and the cost is low due to its simplicity. Generally, an output signal of the system is required to construct a DOB, but for some systems such as magnetic/optical disk drive systems, we cannot measure the position output signal, but only the position error signal (PES). In order to apply a DOB to such systems, we must use an error signal instead of an output signal. We call it the error-based disturbance observer (EDOB) system. We analyze the differences between a conventional DOB system and EDOB system, and show the effectiveness of the proposed EDOB through simulations and experiments. Also, this paper proposes criteria to enhance the robustness of an EDOB system, and reveals the disturbance rejection property of the EDOB system. Finally, we propose a new method of a double Q system to improve the track-following performance. This is also verified through experiments for a DVD 12\&times; optical disk drive system.},

A motivation is given for using fourth-order feedforward with fourth-order trajectories. An algorithm is given for calculating higher-order trajectories with bounds on all considered derivatives for point-to-point moves. It is shown that these trajectories are time-optimal in the most relevant cases. All required equations for fourth-order trajectory planning are derived. Implementation, discretization and quantization effects are considered. Simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments show superior effectiveness of fourth-order feedforward in comparison with lower-order feedforward.},

	abstract     = {High-speed/high-accuracy positioning is a key element in modern mechanical systems such as computer-controlled machine tools, microelectronics manufacturing equipment, mechanical manipulators, and pick-and-place devices. High-speed operations provide increased productivity and high-accuracy positioning ensures improved product quality. Robustness of positioning systems to external disturbances and parameter uncertainties provides reliability and flexibility of the system. The objective of this dissertation is to present a design methodology for high-speed/high-accuracy position control which will yield robust performance under disturbances and parameter variations. A parameter estimation technique coupled with friction compensation is used as the first step in the design process. For robust high-speed tracking, a combination of a feedforward controller and a feedback controller is used. The feedback controller which is based on a disturbance observer compensates external disturbances, unmodeled dynamics, parameter variations, and mechanical nonlinearities. In doing so, it provides robustness and ideal feedback characteristics for feedforward controllers based on the idea of inverse systems such as the zero phase error tracking controller (ZPETC). A major nonlinearity is due to the friction force which includes the stiction (static friction) and Coulomb friction. Through simulations and experiments, the robust tracking controller has demonstrated good tracking performance under a step disturbance and compensated well for the adverse effect due to nonlinear friction. The controller is implemented in a digital signal processing board (TMS320C30 CPU). The position-system testbed is the NSK CT-0505 X-Y table. In order to further enhance the tracking performance, a model-based feedforward friction compensator is added. The robust controller is also implemented in the high-speed machining center (Matsuura MC510VSS). The plant includes both the velocity loop servo pack (P-control) and the feed drive system. A modified disturbance observer has been developed to accommodate the presence of an existing closed-loop servo system. By using the robust tracking controller, superior tracking performance has been achieved in tracking various trajectories which include circular, elliptical and non-circular trajectories.},

	abstract     = {In this dissertation, the use of an accelerometer as a secondary sensor in precision motion control of a linear motor is studied. The acceleration information provides us a number of advantages in the control of mechanical systems. We explore such advantages in three problems: state estimation, system/parameter identification and disturbance estimation problems. In the state estimation problem, the kinematic Kalman filter, which is a discrete-time Kalman filter based on a kinematic model is implemented. The kinematic Kalman filter utilizes both the position encoder and the accelerometer measurements. It is shown that the kinematic Kalman filter estimates system states more accurately than the model-based Kalman filter since the kinematic model does not include any model parameters and system nonlinearities such as friction force. As a further extension, the multirate optimal state estimation algorithms are derived when two sensors are updated with different sampling rates. In the system/parameter identification problem, the accelerometer measurement is utilized to identify the periodic cogging force in the linear permanent-magnet motors. In addition, the measurements from two sensors and the estimated velocity from the kinematic Kalman filter fully describe the physical quantities of the general mechanical systems. Hence, it is possible to identify dynamic parameters of nonlinear models by applying the least squares identification algorithm. In the disturbance estimation problem, the accelerometer measurement is utilized for direct disturbance measurement, estimation and cancellation. In this dissertation, two control problems are considered: In the short stroke tracking control problem, a lumped disturbance is estimated and compensated by the parameter adaptation algorithm. In the long stroke tracking control problem, the cogging force is estimated and directly compensated by utilizing the extended Kalman filter algorithm. These schemes are integrated into a two degree-of-freedom controller structure and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified through simulations and experiments with a linear motor setup.},

This structure is applied to both track seeking and track following, and makes mode switches found in conventional HDD servo systems unnecessary. Two innovative features introduced in the paper are: 1) a new method for generating the reference signal for track seeking and 2) two robust feedback control schemes for rejection of disturbances; one scheme uses a disturbance observer (DOB), and the other uses adaptive robust control (ARC). Simulation results show that the 2 DOF structure with ARC provides better performance than either the conventional servo system with mode switches or the 2 DOF structure with DOB. Experimental results show the advantage of the new reference generation method and the use of the DOB-based robust controller},

	abstract     = {In order to sustain the continuing increase in storage density in magnetic hard disk drives (HDD), high bandwidth dual-stage actuator servo systems have been developed to improve the precision of read/write head positioning control. In this dissertation, robust and adaptive controller design methodologies and algorithms are developed for PZT-actuated suspension and MEMS microactuator based dual-stage servo systems. Active vibration control techniques using dual-stage multi-sensing servo systems to compensate for high-frequency structural vibrations are proposed. A coupled MIMO plant model of a PZT-actuated suspension dual-stage actuator is identified using frequency response modal testing. A structured uncertainty model is established to represent both parametric uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics for robust control design and analysis. Dual-stage controllers are designed using a decoupled single-input single-output (SISO) frequency shaping design technique and multi-variable robust controller design technique $\mu$-synthesis. Experimental results are presented and compared. An active vibration damping control scheme of using one PZT element as a vibration sensor and the other one as an actuator is proposed to damp the resonance modes of the PZT-actuated suspension dual-stage actuator. Vibration damping controller design using Kalman filter based state feedback control is described. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in suppressing airflow excited structural vibrations. For the controller design of a MEMS microactuator based dual-stage servo system, a decoupled design structure with microactuator inner-loop damping and a design methodology by discrete-time pole placement are proposed. A self-tuning control scheme is developed to compensate for the variations in the microactuator's resonance mode. An adaptive feedforward control technique is also developed for active vibration compensation using MEMS microactuator dual-stage servo systems. Simulation results are presented to verify the proposed control schemes.},

Much of the recent work in control theory has led to the development of methods that rigorously address these issues. The motivation for the so-called iterative learning control systems is similar: iterative learning control systems can improve performance and reduce the effects of uncertainty. However, these issues usually receive only heuristic treatment in the design of learning controllers. The purpose of this paper is to extend the rigorous techniques for robust stability and performance to an iterative learning control architecture. The paper discusses precise definitions of robust convergence and performance for this architecture, and demonstrates the authors' initial analysis and design results},

	abstract     = {A disturbance observer based tracking control algorithm is presented in this paper. The key idea of the proposed method is that the plant nonlinearities and parameter variations can be lumped into a disturbance term. The lumped disturbance signal is estimated based on a plant dynamic observer. A state observer then corrects the disturbance estimation in a two-step design. First, a Lyapunov-based feedback estimation law is used. The estimation is then improved by using a feedforward correction term. The control of a telescopic robot arm is used as an example system for the proposed algorithm. Simulation results comparing the proposed algorithm against a standard adaptive control scheme and a sliding mode control algorithm show that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance, especially when large external disturbances are present.},

The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that changing the Q-filter's order fractionally can give a more effective way to adjust control system's frequency and time responses than just tuning it among integer orders. The tradeoff between stability margin loss and the strength of vibration suppression is a common problem in torsional system control. By introducing fractional order control (FOC) approach, control system can be designed more straightforwardly since control system's frequency responses can be altered between integer order control (IOC) system's continuously, while less control parameters are needed to be decided. Design process and experimental results demonstrate that an "EASY \& STRAIGHTFORWARD DESIGN" can be achieved by introducing FOC control design concept. For implementation of the fractional order Q-filter, broken-line approximation method is applied. Even the realization issues for fractional order controllers are somewhat problematic. Experiment results show that the controllers can actually be realized quite acceptably.},

The analysis problem is to characterize conditions for a which the uncertain discrete-time system is positive real for all admissible uncertainties. A linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based analysis result is derived. The synthesis problem is to design linear state-feedback and dynamic output-feedback controllers that robustly stabilize the uncertain discrete-time system and achieve the strict positive realness for the closed-loop transfer functions. It has been established that the problems above can be cast into a class of parameterized strict positive real control problems without uncertainties},

Based on a biomechanical analysis of the foot anatomy and joint kinematics, a sensory system is designed for detecting pressure variations on selected areas of the insole, obtained from four different foot movements that can be purposively controlled by the person. A prototype is developed that integrates four sensitive areas, battery, and electronics into a wearable insole; electronics are used for data acquisition and wireless transmission, in order to have a stand-alone device. The prototype foot interface is experimentally tested in the control of a prosthetic hand, as a model of a typical device that can be effectively operated by foot movements. Experimental trials were conducted with ten able-bodied subjects and the results confirmed the usability and effectiveness of the foot interface in terms of correct and prompt transmission of the user's intention to the controlled device. Comparative experimental trials were performed with electromyography (EMG)-based control of the same prosthesis, which represents the most advanced interface currently available in clinical implants for amputees. The comparative results showed a significant decrease in required adaptation and learning from the user's side},

One effect is the vibration of the individual disk platters at their natural frequencies. These resonances are driven primarily by internal windage excitation within the head disk assembly (HDA) during operation. This behavior is a characteristic of all 3.5 inch disk drives using 95×0.8 mm aluminum disks. The behavior is dominated by the disk material properties and geometry and not by the spindle, enclosure, or structural design. This disk vibration contributes a significant amount of track misregistration (TMR). Alternate disk substrate materials should be investigated as a means for controlling these effects},

Sampling is said to be pathological if the discretized version of a stabilizable/detectable continuous time plant is not itself stabilizable and detectable. Sufficient conditions for nonpathological sampling with a zero order hold have long been known. We extend these to the case of a GSHF, and describe the role in non-pathological sampling played by right half plane zeros of the response function.

The control input update law is time varying. It is shown that the proposed controller has monotonic super-linear convergence. A systematic robustness and performance analysis has been presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the controller. The effect of different design parameters on the closed loop system performance, robustness, learning rate is investigated. The relationship between three critical indices for evaluation of ILC's - performance, rate of learning and robustness - has been studied and inferences drawn about the trade-offs. Numerical simulations verify the results.}

Recently an ANF with global convergence property has been developed for this purpose. There exist some practical applications in which signals are not pure sinusoidal and contain harmonics. Therefore, online frequency estimation of periodic but not necessarily sinusoidal signals espoused by such applications becomes quite important. This note presents an alternative stability analysis for a modified ANF that permits the presence of harmonics in the incoming signal. Also, this stability analysis is simpler and alleviates the problem complexity even in the case of pure sinusoidal signal. Simulation results confirm theoretical issues.}

Recently it has been suggested that in digital control systems such problems may be overcome by using multirate sampling. In this paper we describe the capabilities of such multirate control schemes with regard to pole and zero assignment. We also point out a limitation of the approach due to degradation in the intersample behavior. In Mita and Chida (1988, Proc. 27th Conf. on Dec. and Control, pp. 1883-1888) it is shown that with a two-delay input control scheme it is possible to assign all the poles and zeros of the closed-loop system using state feedback. In this paper we generalize this result to the case of N-delay input control using dynamic compensators. In an N-delay input control scheme the input to the continuous system is changed N times more often than the output is sampled. Using such a scheme we show how to design output feedback controllers for SISO systems that ensure arbitrary placement of all the poles and zeros of the closed-loop system. Corresponding results for the MIMO regulator and the SISO servomechanism are given. We also show that a hidden cost associated with the use of N-delay input control is a degradation in the intersample behavior. We demonstrate this via simulation and present an analysis which explains why this degradation arises.},

Specifically, requirements on the plant are given so that convergence of the learning algorithm ensures monotonic convergence. In particular, for the case where one minus the learning gain times the first Markov parameter is positive, but less than one, it is shown that if the first non-zero Markov parameter of the system has a larger magnitude than the sum of the magnitudes of the next N-1 Markov parameters, then convergence of the learning control algorithm implies monotonic convergence, independent of the learning gain. For the case where one minus the learning gain times the first Markov parameter is negative, but greater than negative one, a condition depending on the learning gain is derived whereby learning convergences also implies monotonic convergence},

The general problem considers sensors with arbitrary locations and arbitrary directional characteristics (gain/phase/polarization) in a noise/interference environment of arbitrary covariance matrix. This report is concerned first with the multiple emitter aspect of this problem and second with the generality of solution. A description is given of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which provides asymptotically unbiased estimates of 1) number of incident wavefronts present; 2) directions of arrival (DOA) (or emitter locations); 3) strengths and cross correlations among the incident waveforms; 4) noise/interference strength. Examples and comparisons with methods based on maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum entropy (ME), as well as conventional beamforming are included. An example of its use as a multiple frequency estimator operating on time series is included.}

It has three main functions: 1) it generates a target trajectory that minimizes the residual vibration due to the primary resonance of a head positioning actuator; 2) it calculates acceleration feedforward that ensures perfect tracking to a target trajectory at position-sampling points; and 3) it re-calculates the target trajectory for feedback control in order to reduce the modeling error, by taking into account the primary mechanical resonance characteristics and the phase delay caused by the control circuit. Simulations and experiments show that the control algorithm improves the settling performance by reducing the vibrations due to both the primary mechanical resonance and the slow transient response induced by the tracking error to the target trajectory. The one-track seek time of a drive controlled by this algorithm is 15\% faster than with the conventional one},

The algorithm is of recursive prediction error (RPE) form and uses a special constrained model of infinite impulse response (IIR) with a minimal number of parameters. The convergent filter is characterized by highly narrow bandwidth and uniform notches of desired shape. For sufficiently large data sets, the variances of the sine wave frequency estimates are of the same order of magnitude as the Cramer-Rao bound. Results from simulations illustrate the performance of the algorithm under a wide range of conditions.}

The dual-actuator system consists of a voice coil motor (VCM) as a first stage actuator and a push-pull-type piezo-electric transducer (PZT) as a second-stage actuator. The settling controller is designed in three steps. In the first step, the VCM controller is designed so that the VCM feedback loop has basic performance and appropriate stability. In the second step, the PZT controller and a decoupling filter are designed in order to achieve superior performance of the dual-actuator system. The decoupling filter, which is placed between the PZT controller output and the VCM controller input, is a PZT output estimator so that the PZT actuator output is canceled at the VCM controller input. In the third step, the reference trajectory is designed for fast and smooth settling. In this study, the closed-loop sensitivity function is used as a performance index, and the gain and phase margins of the open-loop characteristic are used as stability measures. Experimental results show that the dual actuator system with the proposed settling controller achieves better performance than a single actuator system with the same VCM and a conventional settling controller.},

The tool is composed of a set of procedures for the computer-aided design of servocontrollers and a HDD simulator. In order to perform realistic simulations, each part of the HDD is described with high level of detail. As for the mechanics, the usual inertia plus resonance model of the voice coil motor (VCM) has been enriched with nonlinear friction modeling and, in case of DSAs, with the dynamic coupling between primary and secondary actuator. The nonlinear friction model has been tuned on experimental data, using an experimental system presented in the paper. As for the electronics, the VCM driver model is included and quantizations in the position error signal measurement and computation are explicitly considered. Also, in order to evaluate the tracking performance of different servocontrollers, repetitive run outs and nonrepetitive run outs are included. Such disturbances have been obtained from commercial HDDs, with a procedure that is detailed in the paper. The simulator is then validated by comparing simulation and experimental results, both in open-loop and closed-loop conditions, thus, confirming the effectiveness of the developed tool},

Tomizuka (1987); and (2) a compensation of the remaining tracking error with an additional feedforward. First, a closed-form expression is derived for the relation between the <e1>z</e1>-transform of the desired output signal and the <e1>z</e1>-transform of the tracking error resulting from the ZPETC algorithm. From this expression, the time and frequency domain properties are derived. These properties give insight into the parameters that influence the tracking error. Second, the QPTC algorithm is discussed and verified by simulation results. It shows a drastic improvement of tracking over the ZPETC algorithm},

The robustness of motion control will be represented as a function of stiffness and a basis for practical realization. Target of motion is parameterized by control stiffness which could be variable according to the task reference. However, the system robustness of motion always requires very high stiffness in the controller. The paper shows that control of acceleration realizes specified motion simultaneously with keeping the robustness very high. The acceleration is a bridge to connect such robustness and variable stiffness. For practical applications, a technique to estimate disturbance is introduced to make motion controller to be an acceleration controller. Motion control of flexible structure and identification of mechanical parameters are also described.},

In many cases of HDD commercial products, the open loop gain at the lower frequency than 100 Hz does not exceed 40 dB at small actuator swing. It has been longstanding for more than 20 years and considered one of the biggest issues in nano-meter scale positioning. This method named disturbance jammer provides a voltage source for voice coil motor (VCM) driver and a simple current local feedback then naturally compensates the nonlinear torque disturbance. It has been implemented in the HDD head/media evaluation system called ldquoreference drive RD-2rdquo by IMES Co. Ltd, and proved the accuracy which achieved pico-meter scale exceeding nano in practical head positioning on the spinning disk tracks, even under disturbances such as disk windage and flutter. The demonstration strongly supports the possibility of HDD track density to be improved to 1mega track per Inch (TPI) in the near future.},

Although many of the challenges met in control systems design are familiar, there are several serious issues arising from the "2D" structure of ILC and a number of new problems requiring new ways of thinking and design. This paper introduces some of these issues from the point of view of the research group at Sheffield University and concentrates on linear systems and the potential for the use of optimization methods to achieve effective control.},

The method takes advantage of the fact that in this case overall motion takes place with one degree of freedom (DOF) only. Transforming the equations of motion to this one DOF results in a set of equations which defines the phase space of admissible motion constrained by path geometry and joint torques in a transparent way. The time optimal solution representing the maximum mobility of the path-manipulator configuration can be easily determined by a field of extremals bound by a maximum velocity curve, which acts as a trajectory source or sink. Its properties lead to an algorithm for evaluating the time-minimum curve from a sequence of accelerating/ decelerating extremals. Additional optimizing criteria are studied by applying Bellman's principle.},

However, the formulations and results obtained for the rigid-link mechanisms cannot be directly applied to CDPMs due to the unilateral property of cables. This paper focuses on the workspace analysis of fully restrained positioning mechanisms. Because the cable tension is the most essential issue to constrain the moving platform, the force-closure workspace is mainly studied. A general approach is proposed to check the force-closure condition. This condition is expressed in terms of the convex hull which encloses the origin. However, such a condition is formulated and expressed in high dimensions. To simplify the analysis, a recursive dimension reduction algorithm is proposed to check convex hulls in one dimension spaces. This algorithm is verified through simulation results of various CDPMs.},

	abstract     = {For Cable-Driven Parallel Manipulators (CDPMs), employing redundant driving cables is necessary to obtain the full manipulation of the moving platform because of the unilateral driving property of the cables. Unlike rigid-link manipulators, the workspace of CDPMs is always determined and characterized by positive tension status of driving cables. In addition, it has been realized that the Tension Factor (TF) reflecting the relative tension distribution among the driving cables is an appropriate measure to evaluate the quality of tension restraint for CDPMs. However, since redundant cables are employed to drive the moving platform, the TF values are not unique for a particular moving platform pose. Therefore, how to determine the workspace and obtain the optimal TF value so as to generate a workspace with optimized performance become the major subjects of this paper. It is shown that the workspace can be generally formed from tension conditions verified by a recursive dimension-reduction approach and that the optimal TF value at every pose can be efficiently determined through a linear optimization approach, although it is essentially a nonlinear optimization problem. Computational examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

However, a challenge in implementing the optimal-inversion approach is that the resulting inverse input tends to be noncausal. The noncausality of the optimal inverse implies that the desired output trajectory must be pre-specified and cannot be changed online. Therefore, the optimal inverse can only be used in trajectory-planning applications (where the desired output is known in advance for all future time). The main contribution of this article is the development of a technique to compute the noncausal optimal inverse when the desired output trajectory is known in advance for only a finite time interval. This future time interval, during which the desired output trajectory is specified, is referred to as the preview time. Additionally, this article develops a time-domain implementation of the optimal inverse and quantifies the required preview time in terms of the specified accuracy in output tracking, the system dynamics, and the cost function used to develop the optimal inverse. The proposed approach is applied to precision (subnanoscale) positioning of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), which is a key enabling tool in emerging nanotechnologies. Experimental results are presented which show that finite preview of the desired output trajectory is sufficient to operate the STM at high speeds.},

The application of robotics and automation technology can serve to assist, enhance, evaluate, and document neurological and orthopedic rehabilitation. This paper deals with the application of "patient-cooperative" techniques to robot-aided gait rehabilitation of neurological disorders. We define patient-cooperative to mean that, during movement, the technical system takes into account the patient's intention and voluntary efforts rather than imposing any predefined movements or inflexible strategies. It is hypothesized that such cooperative robotic approaches can improve the therapeutic outcome compared to classical rehabilitation strategies. New cooperative strategies are presented that detect the patient's voluntary efforts. First, this enables the patient increased freedom of movement by a certain amount of robot compliance. Second, the robot behavior adapts to the existing voluntary motor abilities. And third, the robotic system displays and improves the patient contribution by visual biofeedback. Initial experimental results are presented to evaluate the basic principle and technical function of proposed approaches. Further improvements of the technical design and additional clinical testing is required to prove whether the therapeutic outcome can be enhanced by such cooperative strategies.},

The proposed method can improve the performance of LQG multirate servo designs without knowing the exact plant parameters or noise model. The effect of controller order on system performance is also studied. For a 4th order system studied, it is found that a 4th order controller is sufficient to achieve the optimal performance},

However, the state error covariance matrix converges uniformly to zero in presence of measurement noise. Moreover, it is shown that, if a certain condition is met, then the knowledge of the state coupling matrix is not needed to apply the proposed stochastic algorithm.

	abstract     = {One of the limitations inherent in high-track-density hard disk drive design is the effect of actuator mechanical resonant modes on the head-positioning servo. The first servo bandwidth limiting mode is the so-called “butterfly mode,? which is the major mode in the head mechanical transfer functions and can not be avoided through mechanical design. A special active damping technique has been developed for rotary actuators of 3-1/2" drives. With an additional sensor on the actuator and an external feedback loop, the butterfly mode can be damped and stiffened while the system stability is maintained. A theoretical system model, based on FEM, modal superposition and feedback control, is developed for analytical prediction of system stability and dynamics. Drive level experiments are conducted on actuators of two different designs, and show that the butterfly mode can be totally damped such that the gain of the head mechanical transfer function is close to 1/s 2. The end arm mode is also damped by about 8 dB for one actuator design. Servo improvement is also studied. It shows that the butterfly mode notch filter can be removed, and the phase margin can be improved by 7 degrees},

Through the results of applications, it is shown that the proposed method is very effective to compensate a variety of disturbances and to improve the performance of a tracking control system in the existence of external disturbances. It is also observed that the proposed state space disturbance observer allows more accurate state estimation in the existence of modeling error and disturbances}

Time is crucial in insemination as the chances of conception decline with increasing delay between the start of estrus and insemination. About 1,090 artificial inseminations of cows are performed daily in Israel. They involve 412 farms in 283 villages, and are performed by 29 inseminators; the work plan should balance the work load among the inseminators. To this end, the working time of an inseminator in each village is required. Thus, a model to predict the working time in a village was developed. Subsequently, a mathematical optimization model was designed and solved, which aims to allocate customers to trips and to determine the itinerary of each trip to minimize total distance/time. The main benefits included a 21.4\% reduction in total traveling time and a 55\% reduction in the difference between the lengths of the longest and shortest working days. Moreover, the longest delay in reaching an estrous cow is reduced from 7.6 to 5.9 h (i.e., by 1.7 h), which may increase the conception ratio by some 7\%. In addition, the trade-off between work balance and total traveling time was studied.},

For the purposes of the paper, only the zero preview case is considered.

	abstract     = {Disk vibration is a significant contributor to track mis-registration (TMR) in todays high performance drives with tracks per inch (TPI) growing at the rate of more than 60\% per year and disk rotating speeds of 10000 rpm. Aluminum disk substrates result in significantly large TMR that can limit the TPI that can be achieved and hence the drive industry is being forced to consider alternate disk substrate materials. In this paper we identified a quantitative measure called "displacement metric" that predicted closely the TMR due to vibration of disk substrate materials. The displacement metric depends on substrate material properties of Young's Modulus, damping and Poisson's ratio and is a better predictor of TMR than traditional measures like specific stiffness. Many substrate vendors are now using this metric to improve the performance of new alternate substrate materials. Laser doppler vibrometer (LDV) measurements in a 10000-RPM disk drive with aluminum, glass, glass-ceramic, alumina, silicon carbide and zirconia disks showed that the cumulative 3-sigma TMR metric due to disk vibration was proportional to the reciprocal of the "displacement metric". Furthermore, we developed a methodology to predict the closed loop TMR due to disk vibration. The closed-loop TMR due to disk vibration was compared for a range of servo bandwidths (800-1600 Hz) for aluminum and alternate substrate materials. This modeling work has proven to be useful in the development of new disk substrate materials and predicting TMR due to disk vibration for higher performance disk drives.},

LQG/LTR is interpreted as the solution of a specific weighted H<sup>2</sup>-tradeoff between transfer functions in the frequency domain. Properties of this solution are examined for both minimum-phase and nonminimum-phase systems. This leads to a formal weight augmentation procedure for the minimum-phase case which permits essentially arbitrary specification of system sensitivity functions in terms of the weights. While such arbitrary specifications are not possible for nonminimum-phase problems, a direct relationship between weights and sensitivities is developed for nonminimum-phase SISO and certain nonminimum-phase MIMO cases which guides the weight selection process.},

The coarse actuator provides the motion required to move the read-write head from one data track to another, while the micro-actuator improves the tracking performance of the servoloop. The micro-actuator also reduces the response time for small seek-length. A simple design approach is adopted in this paper. The coarse actuator loop is first designed for basic performance and stability, using estimated state feedback. The compensator for the micro-actuator is then designed to achieve better performance of the overall system. Simulation and experimental results underscore the effectiveness of the design.},

Moreover, a ZPETC, which is basically in a feedforward control structure, is very sensitive to modeling error. To improve the tracking accuracy of the ZPETC, this paper presents an optimal ZPETC design with a concise polynomial digital prefilter (DPF). The parameters of this well-designed DPF are obtained through the derived L<sub>2</sub>-norm optimization. By cascading the developed DPF to the ZPETC, the resultant optimal ZPETC greatly improves the bandwidth of the tracking control systems while maintaining the zero phase error. Compared with other optimal approaches, the present design leads to much simpler procedures and fewer computations. Furthermore, the proposed optimal ZPETC can be adequately implemented as an adaptive ZPETC by including real-time estimation technique to cope with the external load perturbation and parameter variation. Compared with the other adaptive approaches, the optimal concept is used in the present adaptive ZPETC, and it also renders more accurate results because of its improved magnitude response. Experimental results on a DC servo table with different controllers indicate that when there is no loading, the present optimal ZPETC achieves the best tracking performance. Moreover, the adaptive ZPETC achieves the most satisfactory results when an external load is applied},

For example, in the process industry, composition measurements in distillation columns are typically sampled at a slower rate than temperatures and flow rates. In the context of closed-loop control, such multirate systems pose a challenging problem due to several reasons such as increased complexity in the design with tighter performance specifications. Lifting techniques provide a suitable framework for posing a multirate univariate/multivariate problem as a multivariable single-rate problem. We discuss the application of lifting techniques with respect to asymptotic setpoint tracking. Theoretical results are provided to show that there are constraints on the controller gains for step-type reference signals to ensure there are no intersample oscillations in the closed-loop system. Discrete lifting usually introduces non-uniform steady-state gains for the open-loop lifted model which could result in oscillatory continuous output signals for the closed-loop system. These results are supported by simulation results of a slow sampled and fast control system. Further, we provide a continuous-time interpretation to the design of multirate controllers while providing benchmarks for comparing the closed-loop performance of multi-rate and single rate systems in the LQR framework},

When the structured uncertainty of the family is represented through regions of root location of a certain shape (for instance, circles centered on the real axis), an optimal solution of the problem is provided. For more general uncertainty regions, a simple procedure for constructing sub-optimal solutions to the filter design problem is proposed.

This behavior is a characteristic of all 3.5 inch disk drives using 95×0.8 mm aluminum disks. The behavior is dominated by the disk material properties and geometry and not by the spindle, enclosure, or structural design. This disk vibration contributes a significant amount of track misregistration (TMR). Alternate disk substrate materials should be investigated as a means for controlling these effects},

The problem is here solved via a discrete system representation. This is achieved by describing the closed-loop system as a discrete system with finite state dimension, and with a representation of the disturbance and the output signals of the discrete system as sequences of elements of certain infinite-dimensional spaces. Via finite-rank approximations of a compact integral operator associated with the system, the sampled-data H[infinity] control problem can be solved to any degree of accuracy. From the structure of the problem it follows that irrespective of the order of the approximation, a feasible sampled-data controller can be found which has the same order as the system.},

Low velocity friction, which includes stiction, causes the motion of an axis to have a nonsmooth start and to stop near zero velocity introducing positioning and tracking errors. Friction has been studied extensively in tribology. Mathematical models exist to characterize friction mechanisms. One definite information available from the models is that friction force primarily depends on the axis velocity. Based on this information, a practical approach for friction compensation is to use a feedforward controller, the output of which depends on the command velocity. Repetitive control can be applied to synthesize such feedforward control laws by repeated trials. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by experiments on a machine tool feed drive. Also discussed are standard feedback control approaches for friction compensation and an open-loop pulse control strategy for situations where a motion axis must be moved over a minute distance},

The algorithm computes a feedforward signal in two steps: (1) a feedforward signal based on the zero phase error tracking control (ZPETC) algorithm of M. Tomizuka (1987); and (2) a compensation of the remaining tracking error with an additional feedforward. First, a closed-form expression is derived for the relation between the <e1>z</e1>-transform of the desired output signal and the <e1>z</e1>-transform of the tracking error resulting from the ZPETC algorithm. From this expression, the time and frequency domain properties are derived. These properties give insight into the parameters that influence the tracking error. Second, the QPTC algorithm is discussed and verified by simulation results. It shows a drastic improvement of tracking over the ZPETC algorithm}

	abstract     = {This dissertation is concerned with digital tracking control and its application to noncircular machining, which is a turning operation for generating a noncircular cross-sectional workpiece by fast tool positioning in the radial direction of the workpiece. The tracking problem is formulated as a task of achieving a specified input-output map by feed-forward compensation. Tracking performance is evaluated based on a norm of the error between the achievable and target I/O map. Optimal performance is the infimum of the norm. Use of H$\backslash$sb2, H$\backslash$sb\{$\backslash$infty\} and l$\backslash$sb1 norms is considered. A tracking controller can be evaluated by the closeness of its performance norm to the optimal one. A special tracking controller, the zero phase error tracking controller, is shown to be near optimal when the unstable zero(s) of the plant are located in some region. When a fixed parameter feed-forward controller is used, tracking performance is sensitive to plant uncertainties and variations. To overcome this problem, adaptive feed-forward controllers and repetitive controllers are proposed. The adaptive controller is of the indirect type, and does not require the minimum phase condition of the plant or the persistently exciting condition of the input signal. A relative dead zone function is introduced in the adaptive identifier for robust parameter estimation. The repetitive controller is based on the internal model principle and provides asymptotic perfect tracking of periodic desired outputs. A design method is developed for a repetitive controller, which features fast error convergent rate, simple parameterization and efficient real-time implementation. Repetitive controllers are not robust to unmodeled dynamics because the loop gain reaches infinity at repetitive frequencies. A method is established for obtaining a trade-off between robustness and tracking performance. Experiments are carried out on a hydraulic servo system to evaluate the performance of the proposed digital tracking algorithms and to implement the concept of noncircular machining. The experimental results are consistent with the analytical predictions and the implementation of noncircular machining is successful. A path planning scheme for machining a workpiece to a shape with sharp corners is also proposed.},

It results in a noncausal reference model with a low-pass characteristic with selectable bandwidth and zero phase shift. A new feedback design approach, based on a state and disturbance observer is introduced. A loop transfer recovery procedure tunes the observer gains to compromise optimally between performance and robustness.},

Since the controller requires an estimate of the unmeasurable friction state, we demonstrate how the friction dynamics can be exploited to design three different observers which foster different transient response characteristics for the composite closed-loop system. We then present two adaptive controllers which utilize nonlinear observer/filter structures to provide for asymptotic position tracking while compensating for selected parametric uncertainty. Dynamic simulation and experimental results are utilized to illustrate control performance},

The second deposition involved wrapping a thin film of nanotubes around the optical fiber. For both cases, interaction of transmitted light through the fiber core with the external coating was assisted by the cladding mode resonances of a tilted fiber Bragg grating. Ultrafast nonlinear effects of the nanotube-coated fiber were measured by means of a pump-probe pulses experiment.},

The servo compensator designed through linear-quadratic Gaussian control combined with loop transfer recovery (LQG/LTR) consists of a Kalman filter for state estimation and state feedback for control. The desired tracking servo performance is first formulated through a frequency shaped return ratio of the Kalman filter and subsequently recovered at the output of the plant/compensator loop through the automatic design of a discrete-time linear quadratic (LQ) regulator. Particular attention has been given to modeling the calculation time delay and bias force estimation. The excellent robustness and performance characteristics of a continuous time LQG/LTR design are theoretically unachievable due to the extremely low sampling rate and nonminimum phase plant characteristics. However, both time and frequency domain simulations show that reasonable stability margins and performance can still be recovered. This technique nearly eliminates all the trial and error typical of a conventional pole placement design of a similar system. The direct discrete-time design can handle extremely low sampling rates associated with embedded servo systems. The technique can also be used for designing multi-rate and multi-input servo systems},

To facilitate this concept, a nonlinear disturbance observer is developed for disturbances generated by an exogenous system, and global exponential stability is established under certain condition. Furthermore, semiglobal stability condition of the composite controller consisting of a nonlinear controller and the nonlinear disturbance observer is established. The developed method is illustrated by the application to control of a two-link robotic manipulator.},

	abstract     = {Improving the position control of the disk drive read/write heads is an important step in increasing the storage capacity of a drive, especially in the presence of internal and external disturbances. To address this problem, the typical feedback loop of a disk drive servo system was augmented with a disturbance observer. The disturbance observer uses the position error signal and a nominal model of the plant to create an estimate of the disturbance.

The technique of initializing the states of the peak filter is proposed to preserve the smoothness of transient response when the dual-stage servo loop is switched on from track-seeking to track-following. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed dual-stage control scheme could effectively suppress the midfrequency disturbance without compromising the settling performance. This method would enhance the disturbance attenuation of the dual-stage servo system for higher track density in HDDs.},

It is based on a so-called indirect approach, where the frequency of the disturbance is estimated in real time, and the estimate is used in a disturbance rejection scheme designed for a known frequency. Improvements over an earlier algorithm include an extension to multi-channel systems, a better frequency estimation algorithm, and a thorough experimental evaluation. For disturbance rejection, a so-called inverse G algorithm is proposed and its properties are compared through analysis and experiments to those of a gradient algorithm. A new frequency estimator is also considered that is simple and flexible in design, and is able to use multiple harmonics or multiple signals in order to estimate the fundamental frequency of the noise source. In this manner, the algorithm maintains tracking of the fundamental frequency despite significant changes in signal characteristics. The ability of the indirect approach to reject periodic noise with fixed or time-varying frequency and amplitudes is demonstrated in active noise control experiments. The algorithm may also be useful in other control applications where periodic disturbances of unknown frequency must be rejected.},

A simple algorithm is proposed to find the minimum degree of the controller so as to make the gap of the maximum gain less than any given positive number. Finally, the proposed scheme is applied to the servomotor used in a direct drive robot.

In this paper, we clarify the class of the robust servo system realized by adjusting the order of the disturbance observer and show design of an estimated disturbance feedback by the disturbance observer, which can represent a classical control approach.

In order to solve this problem, a feedforward controller termed Optimal-Feedforward Controller with Zero Phase Error Tracking Controller (Optimal-FCZPETC) is introduced. With this controller, the phase characteristics of the overall system is zero for all frequencies and the maximum value of the gap between the gain of the overall system and unity, which is ideal gain characteristics, is minimized under given preview steps. The choice of the preview steps is an unsolved problem. In this paper, we investigate the Optimal-FCZPETC from the viewpoint of the preview steps. The contribution is to give explicitly the minimum value of the maximum gap between the gain of the overall system and unity for given preview steps and to show that the minimum value can be made arbitrarily small as the preview steps increase. As a result, a simple algorithm is proposed to find the minimum preview steps such that the gain characteristics of the overall system is within an arbitrarily specified bound. The effectiveness is shown by simulation results.},

Instead of considering the state only at sampling instants, this paper introduces a function piece during the sampling period as the state and gives an infinite-dimensional model with such a state space. This gives the advantage that sampled data systems with built-in intersample behavior can be regarded as linear, time-invariant, discrete-time systems. As a result, the approach makes it possible to introduce such time-invariant concepts as transfer functions, poles, and zeros to the sampled data systems even with the presence of the intersample behavior. In particular, tracking problems can be studied in this setting in a simple and unified way, and ripples are completely characterized as a mismatch between the intersample reference signal and transmission zero directions. This leads to the internal model principle for sampled data systems},

The arms, waist and legs have pneumatic rotary actuators driven directly by micro air pumps supplied by portable Ni-Cd batteries. The muscle forces are sensed by a new muscle hardness sensor utilizing a sensing tip mounted on a force sensing film device. The embedded microcomputer calculates the necessary joint torque for maintaining a position according to the equations derived from static body mechanics using the joint angles, and the necessary joint torque is combined with the output signals of the muscle sensors to make control signals. The suit was applied practically to a human body and movement experiments that weights in the arms were held and take up and down was performed.

Generally, an output signal of the system is required to construct a DOB, but for some systems such as magnetic/optical disk drive systems, we cannot measure the position output signal, but only the position error signal (PES). In order to apply a DOB to such systems, we must use an error signal instead of an output signal. We call it the error-based disturbance observer (EDOB) system. We analyze the differences between a conventional DOB system and EDOB system, and show the effectiveness of the proposed EDOB through simulations and experiments. Also, this paper proposes criteria to enhance the robustness of an EDOB system, and reveals the disturbance rejection property of the EDOB system. Finally, we propose a new method of a double Q system to improve the track-following performance. This is also verified through experiments for a DVD 12\&times; optical disk drive system.},

By properly designing a disturbance compensation gain, a novel composite controller is proposed to counteract the "mismatched" lumped disturbances from the output channels. The proposed method significantly extends the applicability of the DOBC methods. Rigorous stability analysis of the closed-loop system with the proposed method is established under mild assumptions. The proposed method is applied to a nonlinear MAGnetic LEViation (MAGLEV) suspension system. Simulation shows that compared to the widely used integral control method, the proposed method provides significantly improved disturbance rejection and robustness against load variation.},

A photomask technique is used for fabricating the grating with the Ti/Pt/Au interdigital electrodes. With the variation of the equivalent phase face induced by the quadratic electro-optic effect of the PMNT ceramic, the diffraction patterns of the light beam will be changed in which the diffraction efficiency may be controlled by an applied DC voltage. When the applied voltages are 41, 80, and 139 V, the zero-order, first-order, or second-order diffraction lights will disappear in turn with about 100\% diffraction efficiency. The proposed grating can be used as an electrically controlled switch in the laser beam modulation and scanning, especially for the application of the high-power laser systems.},

	abstract     = {The zero phase error tracking controller (ZPETC) in motion control, as proposed by Tomizuka (1987) , renders the desirable zero phase error, but with a limited gain response. Moreover, a ZPETC, which is basically in a feedforward control structure, is very sensitive to modeling error. To improve the tracking accuracy of the ZPETC, this paper presents an optimal ZPETC design with a concise polynomial digital prefilter (DPF). The parameters of this well-designed DPF are obtained through the derived L2-norm optimization. By cascading the developed DPF to the ZPETC, the resultant optimal ZPETC greatly improves the bandwidth of the tracking control systems while maintaining the zero phase error. Compared with other optimal approaches, the present design leads to much simpler procedures and fewer computations. Furthermore, the proposed optimal ZPETC can be adequately implemented as an adaptive ZPETC by including real-time estimation technique to cope with the external load perturbation and parameter variation. Compared with the other adaptive approaches, the optimal concept is used in the present adaptive ZPETC, and it also renders more accurate results because of its improved magnitude response. Experimental results on a DC servo table with different controllers indicate that when there is no loading, the present optimal ZPETC achieves the best tracking performance. Moreover, the adaptive ZPETC achieves the most satisfactory results when an external load is applied},

Much of the recent work in control theory has led to the development of methods that rigorously address these issues. The motivation for the so-called iterative learning control systems is similar: iterative learning control systems can improve performance and reduce the effects of uncertainty. However, these issues usually receive only heuristic treatment in the design of learning controllers. The purpose of this paper is to extend the rigorous techniques for robust stability and performance to an iterative learning control architecture. The paper discusses precise definitions of robust convergence and performance for this architecture, and demonstrates the authors' initial analysis and design results},

In particular, they studied the asymptotic bias in the frequency estimates produced by the ALE with the near-optimum and the usual choices of $\Delta$. In the finite-data case, they used computer simulations to study the variance of the frequency estimates in relation to the Cramer-Rao bound. The analysis and the simulations show that the frequency estimates obtained with the near-optimum choice of $\Delta$ are much superior with respect to bias, variance, and the threshold SNR than the estimates produced with the usual choice, $\Delta$=1},

The authors show that the use of feedforward controllers cannot improve the tracking error beyond what is achievable with a properly designed feedback loop, over all plant uncertainties.

The main idea is to define a functional depending on velocity or its derivatives that measures smoothness of trajectories and find a trajectory that minimizes this functional. In order to ensure that the computed trajectories are independent of the parametrization of positions and orientations, we use the notions of Riemannian metric and covariant derivative from differential geometry and formulate the problem as a variational problem on the Lie group of spatial rigid body displacements. We show that by choosing an appropriate measure of smoothness, the trajectories can be made to satisfy boundary conditions on the velocities or higher order derivatives. Dynamically smooth trajectories can be obtained by incorporating the inertia of the system into the definition of the Riemannian metric. We state the necessary conditions for the shortest distance, minimum acceleration and minimum jerk trajectories},

It is shown that the steady-state performance of an L-weight ALE for this case can be modeled by the L × L Wiener-Hopf matrix equation and that this matrix equation can be transformed into a set of 2N coupled linear equations, where N is the number of sinusoids. It is also shown that the expected values of the ALE weights in steady state can be written as a sum of sinusoids and that the amplitude of each sinusoid is coupled to that of all other sinusoids by coefficients that approach zero as the number of ALE weights becomes large. The analytical results are compared to experimental results obtained with a hardware implementation of the ALE of variable length (up to 256 weights) and show good agreement. Theoretical expressions for linear predictive spectral estimates are also derived for multiple sinusoids in white noise. Comparisons are made between the magnitude of the discrete Fourier transform of the ALE weights and the linear predictive spectral estimate for two sinusoids in white noise.},

Such increased proximity to obstructions places heightened maneuverability requirements on the aircraft and extreme levels of workload on the pilot. The basic issue being addressed in the NASA Automated Nap-of-the-Earth (ANOE) program is the intelligent use of environmental information such as knowledge of terrain, obstacles, and other external factors to enhance the flight path guidance of the vehicle, This is a major departure over contemporary guidance and control based on feedback of state variables such as vehicle attitudes, velocities, and accelerations, Although the immediate program has a military focus, the technological advances inherent for automating NOE flight have great benefit to the operation of a wide class of vehicles such as emergency medical helicopters, conventional and high-speed transports, unmanned aerial vehicles, and planetary vehicles, This paper summarizes results to date of the NASA ANOE program in the areas of passive and active sensors, pilot displays, low-altitude manual trajectory guidance, and NOE automatic guidance, Each of these areas has been developed and evaluated in piloted, motion-based simulation or through flight test, These evaluations have demonstrated the feasibility of automating the NOE flight mission, and have generated additional spin-off applications of the technologies.},

Reliability is compromised in case the noise measurement is acoustically coupled to the actual active noise cancellation {(ANC)}, as stability and performance of the feedforward compensation becomes ambiguous. This paper presents a framework to recursively estimate a feedforward filter in the presence of acoustic coupling, addressing both stability and performance of the active feedforward noise cancellation algorithm. The framework is based on fractional model representations in which a feedforward filter is parameterized by coprime factorization. Conditions on the parameterization of the coprime factorization formulated by the existence of a stable perturbation enables stability in the presence of acoustic coupling. In addition, the paper shows how the stable perturbation can be estimated on-line via a recursive least-squares estimation of a generalized {FIR} filter to improve the performance of the feedforward filter for {ANC.}},

This paper presents a general second-order filter that can reject narrow-band disturbances at any frequency range. The filter zero is designed to minimally degrade the closed-loop system stability and obtain a smooth sensitivity curve around the disturbance frequency. The paper presents a nonlinear optimization procedure for selecting the filter parameters so that the statistical position error is minimized. Experimental results of a piezoelectrically actuated head positioning control system on a spinstand demonstrate that the add-on filter can further reduce the midfrequency nonrepeatable runout of the position error signal by 8\% and preserve the stability margin of the original feedback control system},

The echo replica is subtracted from a local input signal to create a first residual signal, and local background noise is canceled from the first residual signal to create a second residual signal. The echo/noise canceler also stores older samples of the received signal, and uses these older samples and the second residual signal to adjust the coefficients in the adaptive filter. The delay between the recent samples and the older samples compensates for the noise cancellation processing delay between the first residual signal and the second residual signal.},

Among its many accolades, that first edition was cited by the AAP as the Best Engineering Handbook of 1996. Now, 15 years later, William Levine has once again compiled the most comprehensive and authoritative resource on control engineering. He has fully reorganized the text to reflect the technical advances achieved since the last edition and has expanded its contents to include the multidisciplinary perspective that is making control engineering a critical component in so many fields. Now expanded from one to three volumes, The Control Handbook, Second Edition brilliantly organizes cutting-edge contributions from more than 200 leading experts representing every corner of the globe. The first volume, Control System Fundamentals, offers an overview for those new to the field but is also of great value to those across any number of fields whose work is reliant on but not exclusively dedicated to control systems. Covering mathematical fundamentals, defining principles, and basic system approaches, this volume:  Details essential background, including transforms and complex variables  Includes mathematical and graphical models used for dynamical systems  Covers analysis and design methods and stability testing for continuous-time systems  Delves into digital control and discrete-time systems, including real-time software for implementing feedback control and programmable controllers  Analyzes design methods for nonlinear systems  As with the first edition, the new edition not only stands as a record of accomplishment in control engineering but provides researchers with the means to make further advances. Progressively organized, the other two volumes in the set include:  Control System Applications Control System Advanced Methods},

First the following idealized identification problem is considered: a discrete-time system has vector inputx(t)and scalar outputz(t)= h ' x(t)wherehis an unknown time-invariant coefficient vector. The filter considered adjusts an estimate vectorhat\{h\}(t)in a control loop according tohat\{h\}(t + Delta t) = hat\{h\}(t) + K{[}z(t) - hat\{z\} (t)]x(t), wherehat\{z\}( t)= hat\{h\}( t) ' x( t)andKis the control loop gain. The effectiveness of the filter is determined by the convergence properties of the misalignment vectorr(t) = h - hat\{h\}(t). It is shown that a certain nondegeneracy "mixing" condition on the Input \{ x(t)\} is necessary and sufficient for the exponential convergence of the misalignment. Qualitatively identical upper and lower bounds are derived for the rate of convergence. Situations where noise is present inz(t)andx(t)and the coefficient vectorhis time-varying are analyzed. Nonmixing inputs are also considered, and it is shown that in the idealized model the above stability results apply with only minor modifications. However, nonmixing input in conjunction with certain types of noise lead to bounded input - unbounded output, i.e., instability.},

A very simple model for the input signal vectors that greatly simplifies analysis of the convergence behavior of the LMS and NLMS algorithms is proposed. Using this model, answers can be obtained to questions for which no answers are currently available using other (perhaps more realistic) models. Examples are given to illustrate that even quantitatively, the answers obtained can be good approximations. It is emphasized that the convergence of the NLMS algorithm can be speeded up significantly by employing a time-varying step size. The optimal step-size sequence can be specified a priori for the case of a white input signal with arbitrary distribution},

The stability and robustness of these schemes with respect to inevitable unmodeled dynamics and noise disturbances in the absence of persistently exciting signals has not been established despite successful simulation results and implementations. The purpose of this technical note is to propose a robust adaptive scheme for rejection of unknown periodic components of the disturbance and analyze its stability and performance properties. First, we consider the ideal case (non-adaptive) when complete information about the characteristics of the disturbance is available. We show that the rejection of periodic terms may lead to amplification of output noise and in some cases lead to a worse output performance. The way to avoid such undesirable noise amplification is to increase the size of the feedback control filter in order to have the flexibility to achieve rejection of the periodic disturbance terms while minimizing the effect of the noise on the output. The increased filter order leads to an over-parameterized scheme where persistence of excitation is no longer possible, and this shortcoming makes the use of robust adaptation essential. With this important insight in mind, the coefficients of the feedback filter whose size is over parameterized are adapted using a robust adaptive law. We show analytically that the proposed robust adaptive control scheme guarantees stability, performance and robustness with respect to unmodeled dynamics and bounded broadband noise disturbances. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate the results.},

The obtained parameter estimates of the identification model include the product terms of the parameters of the original systems. Two methods of separating the parameter estimates of the original parameters from the product terms are discussed: the average method and the singular value decomposition method. To improve the identification accuracy, an extended stochastic gradient algorithm with a forgetting factor is presented. The simulation results indicate that the parameter estimation errors become small by introducing the forgetting factor.},

By measuring dose and frequency responses in single cells, we characterize the precision, timing, and efficiency with which signals are transmitted from Ras to Erk. Moreover, we elucidate how a single pathway can specify distinct physiological outcomes: by combining distinct temporal patterns of stimulation with proteomic profiling, we identify signaling programs that differentially respond to Ras dynamics, including a paracrine circuit that activates STAT3 only after persistent (\ensuremath{>}1 hr) Ras activation.

In the discrete-time setting, this problem plays an important role in digital quantization. Several results are presented. First, we prove that this plant family is robustly SPR if and only if all {\textquotedblleft}corner plants{\textquotedblright} in the family are SPR. We then show that, if this plant family is robustly SPR, it admits a multiaffine Lyapunov matrix for the Kalman-Yakubovic-Popov (KYP) inequality, i.e., the Lyapunov matrix is multiaffine in the uncertain parameters. This result is useful in robustness analysis of time-varying systems. Finally, we relate the robust SPRness of this plant family to the robust strict bounded realness (SBRness) of a plant family involving the inverse of N(s,qn)D-1 (s,q d). We show that multiaffine Lyapunov matrix for the KYP inequality of the first plant family yields a multiaffine Lyapunov matrix for the bounded real inequality of the second plant family. Finally, the robust SPR problem is considered for a more general plant family with applications in circuits and communication systems},

One example is the track-following control in a hard disk drive (HDD) system, where the airflow-excited disk and actuator vibrations introduce strong and uncertain spectral peaks to the position error signal. Such narrow-band vibrations differ in each product and can appear at frequencies above the bandwidth of the control system. We present a feedback control scheme that adaptively enhances the servo performance at multiple unknown frequencies, while maintaining the baseline servo loop shape. A minimum parameter model of the disturbance is first introduced, followed by the construction of a novel adaptive multiple narrow-band disturbance observer for selective disturbance cancellation. Evaluation of the proposed algorithm is performed on a simulated HDD benchmark problem.},

Additional subjects encompass linear observers; compensator design by the separation principle; linear, quadratic optimum control; random processes; and Kalman filters.Concrete examples of how state-space methods can be used to advantage in several representative applications are woven into the fabric of the text and the homework problems. Many of the models are drawn from aerospace and inertial instrumentation; other examples are derived from chemical process control, maritime operations, robotics, and energy systems.},

	abstract     = {A newly developed theory of liquid water transport in hydrophobic gas diffusion layers is applied to simulate flooding in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) and its effects on performance. The numerical model accounts for simultaneous two-phase flow and transport of species and electrochemical kinetics, utilizing the well-established multiphase mixture formulation to efficiently model the two-phase transport processes. The two-phase model is developed in a single domain, yielding a single set of governing equations valid in all components of a PEFC. The model is used to explore the two-phase flow physics in the cathode gas diffusion layer. Multidimensional simulations reveal that flooding of the porous cathode reduces the rate of oxygen transport to the cathode catalyst layer and causes a substantial increase in cathode polarization. Furthermore, the humidification level and flow rate of reactant streams are key parameters controlling PEFC performance and two-phase flow and transport characteristics. It is also found that minimization of performance limitations such as membrane dry-out and electrode flooding depends not only on material characteristics but also on the optimization of these operating parameters. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

In this paper, it is shown that there exist orthogonal functions that, in a natural way, are generated by stable linear dynamical systems and that compose an orthonormal basis for the signal space l2n . To this end, use is made of balanced realizations of inner transfer functions. The orthogonal functions can be considered as generalizations of, for example, the pulse functions, Laguerre functions, and Kautz functions, and give rise to an alternative series expansion of rational transfer functions. It is shown how we can exploit these generalized basis functions to increase the speed of convergence in a series expansion, i.e., to obtain a good approximation by retaining only a finite number of expansion coefficients. Consequences for identification of expansion coefficients are analyzed, and a bound is formulated on the error that is made when approximating a system by a finite number of expansion coefficients},

	abstract     = {The adaptive feedback approach is now widely used for the rejection of multiple narrow band disturbances with unknown and time varying frequencies in Active Vibration Control (AVC) and Active Noise Control (ANC). The approach is based directly or indirectly on the use of the Internal Model Principle and the Youla-Ku{\v c}era parametrization combined with an adaptive law. All the algorithms associated with the approach make the assumption that the plant zeros are different from the poles of the disturbance model in order to achieve disturbance compensation. However in practice the problem is more intricate since it is not clear what happens if the plant have very low damped complex zeros (often encountered in mechanical structures) and the frequency of the disturbance is close to the anti-resonance frequency (the resonance frequency of the plant zeros). A recent international investigation on adaptive regulation in the presence of unknown time varying disturbances {[}16] has considered such a situation for a benchmark example. Several solutions have been proposed and the most successful has been based on the appropriate choice of the desired closed loop poles to be achieved by the Youla-Ku{\v c}era central controller {[}5] using a Q FIR filter with the minimum number of parameters. Recently in {[}12] it was suggested that over parametrization of the Q (FIR) filter can enhance the robustness of the linear and adaptive scheme in the vicinity of plant complex zeros. The present paper compares these two approaches using the same benchmark example as in {[}16]. The results from simulations and real time experiments used to evaluate the two approaches are presented.},

Experiments are conducted on a spin stand to evaluate the TMR due to air flow excited suspension vibration using LDV. Adaptive feedforward control is designed to cancel suspension vibration, by using the strain signal on the surface of the instrumented suspension, and controlling slider with a MEMS microactuator (MA). An off-line MA model identification method, which does not utilizes relative position sensing is also proposed. Simulations show the proposed technique can successfully suppress the suspension vibration induced TMR},

Several tests were made to prove the reliability of this method, that has proved to be useful to extract the information required by the race. Fusion was performed both at a low and medium level: terrain slope, detected with stereo vision, was used to correct pitch information of laserscanner raw data.

Such disturbances are often encountered in active noise and vibration control, due to rotating machinery. The emphasis of the paper is on feedback control problems where reference sensors are not available. The case where the frequency of the disturbance is known is considered first. Two sets of algorithms are discussed: one based on the internal model principle of feedback control theory, and the second based on adaptive feedforward cancellation. An interesting observation is that algorithms originating from both approaches can be shown to be equivalent under certain conditions. When the frequency of the disturbance is unknown, an intuitive approach consists in combining a method for the rejection of disturbances of known frequency with a frequency estimator. Alternatively, one may seek to develop a stable adaptation mechanism so that the disturbance is cancelled asymptotically. While algorithms can be designed to adapt to plant and disturbance parameters, the most successful approaches use some limited plant information to adapt the magnitude, frequency, and phase parameters of the control signal. Applications are discussed throughout the paper. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In particular, we demonstrate the viability and necessity of symmetrical sensors for cancellation of common non-off-track modes in the measurement. Thin-film ZnO strain sensors have been successfully integrated into instrumented suspension prototypes, and strain signals were extracted from operating disk drives. High-resolution strain sensing allowed us to investigate the nature of airflow excitation of the suspension structure. Experimental measurements were used to construct both ideal and realistic models. Using the ideal model that ignored non-off-track modes, multirate nominal H 2 control synthesis and simulation were employed to evaluate potential improvements in closed-loop vibration suppression in a multisensor framework. These simulations projected improved tracking performance using auxiliary high-resolution strain sensing with increased sample rate. However, when a robust H 2 damping controller was designed using a more realistic model of the available hardware, performance in simulation and experiment was limited by numerous non-off-track modes in the sensor signal.},

We analyze how the discrete-time NMP zero locations in the z-plane affect the success of the NPZ-Ignore, ZPETC, and ZMETC model-inverse techniques. We also examine the use of low-pass filters with the three model-inversion techniques. Experimental results on the x direction of an AFM piezoscanner are provided to support the discussions.

	abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a modeling-free inversion-based iterative feedforward control (MIIFC) approach for high-speed output tracking of single-input single-output linear time-invariant systems. The recently developed inversion-based iterative learning control (IIC) techniques provide a straightforward manner to quantify and account for the effect of dynamics uncertainty on iterative learning control performance, thereby arriving at rapid convergence of the iterative control input. However, dynamics model and thereby the modeling process are still needed, and the model quality directly limits the performance of the IIC techniques. The main contribution of this paper is the development of the MIIFC algorithm to eliminate the dynamics modeling process, and significantly improve the tracking performance. The disturbance (measurement noise) effect on the tracking precision is addressed in the convergence analysis of the MIIFC algorithm. The allowable disturbance/noise level to guarantee the convergence is quantified in frequency domain, and the noise level can be estimated through the noise spectrum measured before the whole operation. The MIIFC technique is demonstrated by applying it to the output tracking of a piezotube scanner on an atomic force microscope. The experimental results showed that precision output tracking of a frequency-rich desired trajectory with power spectrum similar to a band-limited white noise can be achieved.},

Structures that are used in the recent literature encompass e.g. gap metric uncertainty, coprime factor uncertainty, and the Vinnicombe gap metric uncertainty. In this paper, we study the effect of these choices by comparing the sets of controllers that guarantee robust stability for the different model uncertainty bounds. In general these controller sets intersect. However in particular cases the controller sets are embedded, leading to uncertainty structures that are favourable over others. In particular, when restricting the controller set to be constructed as metric-bounded perturbations around the present controller, the so-called double Youla parametrization provides a set of robustly stabilizing controllers that is larger than corresponding sets that are achieved by using any of the other uncertainty structures. This is particularly of interest in controller tuning problems.},

The rainfall data come from a dense network of recording rain gauges that cover approximately 2000 km2 around Mexico City. The reference rain sample accounts for the 50 most significant events, whose mean duration is about 10 h and maximal point depth 170 mm. Three models were tested using different runoff production models: storm-runoff coefficient, complete or partial interception. These models were then applied to four fictitious homogeneous basins, whose sizes range from 20 to 1500 km2. For each test, the sensitivity of the model is expressed as the relative differences between the empirical distribution of the peak flows (and runoff volumes), calculated according to the two patterns of rainfall input: uniform or non-uniform. Differences in flows range from 10 to 80\%, depending on the type of runoff production model used, the size of the basin and the return period of the event. The differences are generally moderate for extreme events. In the local context, this means that uniform design rainfall combining point rainfall distribution and the probabilistic concept of the areal reduction factor could be sufficient to estimate major flood probability. Differences are more significant for more frequent events. This can generate problems in calibrating the hydrological model when spatial rainfall localization is not taken into account: a bias in the estimation of parameters makes their physical interpretation difficult and leads to overestimation of extreme flows.},

Usually, input data of the network are composed by past measurements of flows and rainfalls, without providing a description of the saturation state of the basin, which, in contrast, plays a key role in the rainfall-runoff process. This paper couples neural networks and fuzzy logic in order to enrich the description of the basin saturation state for flood forecasting purposes. The basin state is assessed analyzing the total rainfall occurred on a certain time window before the flood event. The proposed framework first classifies the basin saturation state providing a set of fuzzy memberships, and then issues the forecast exploiting a set of neural predictors, each specialized on certain basin saturation condition by means of a weighted least-square training algorithm. The outputs of the specialized neural predictors are linearly weighted, according to the basin state at forecast time: The more the training conditions of a predictor matches the current basin saturation state, the higher its weight on the final forecast. The framework has been tested on an Italian catchment and may overperform classical neural networks approaches.},

These diverse areas echo the classes of models which conveniently describe each corresponding system. Thus although there can hardly be a "general theory of adaptive systems" encompassing both the modelling task and the design of the adaptation procedure, nevertheless, these diverse issues have a major common component: namely the use of adaptive algorithms, also known as stochastic approximations in the mathematical statistics literature, that is to say the adaptation procedure (once all modelling problems have been resolved). The juxtaposition of these two expressions in the title reflects the ambition of the authors to produce a reference work, both for engineers who use these adaptive algorithms and for probabilists or statisticians who would like to study stochastic approximations in terms of problems arising from real applications. Hence the book is organised in two parts, the first one user-oriented, and the second providing the mathematical foundations to support the practice described in the first part. The book covers the topcis of convergence, convergence rate, permanent adaptation and tracking, change detection, and is illustrated by various realistic applications originating from these areas of applications.},

In all cases, the structural losslessness property induces very robust performance in the face of multiplier coefficient quantization.

A classical problem in adaptive control and communication theory concerns the tracking of the best fit of a given form (generally linear in certain parameters, although the authors do not assume this linear form here) when the statistics or the parameters change slowly. A major, and yet unresolved, problem has been the choice of the step sizes in the tracking algorithm. An algorithm for adapting the step size using the same system measurements which are used for the tracking was suggested by Benveniste (1990), and various examples worked out by Brossier (1992). The numerical results were very encouraging. But proofs were lacking. These proofs are supplied here together with supporting numerical data. The proofs are based on results in stochastic approximation. The adaptive step size technique works very well indeed, and is a major accomplishment. Much supporting analysis is presented, particularly concerning the interpretation of certain stationary processes as {\textquotedblleft}stationary{\textquotedblright} pathwise derivatives. Finite difference forms are also treated. These are mathematically simpler, and can be applied to a wide variety of systems, even when the system is not well modelled. The data shows that they work well. Quite general systems can be handled. The authors do not assume that the step sizes in the tracking algorithm are vanishingly small. Indeed, the numerical data show that the optimum step sizes are often not particularly small},

Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner.},

We then review how such schemes can be applied in practice and consider issues of space discretization, time discretization and model parameterisation, before going on to consider model assessment procedures. We show that a key advantage of reduced complexity codes is that they force modellers to think about the minimum process representation necessary to predict particular quantities and act as a check on any tendency to reductionism. At the same time, however, the use (compared to standard hydraulic codes) of strong simplifying assumptions requires us to also address the question {\textquotedblleft}how simple can a model be and still be physically realistic?{\textquotedblright} We show that by making explicit this debate about acceptable levels of abstraction, reduced complexity codes allow progress to be made in addressing a number of long-standing debates in hydraulics.},

The general results are specialized to two leading cases, linear instrumental variables regression and GMM estimation of Euler equations obtained from the consumption-based capital asset pricing model with power utility.

	abstract     = {Gene expression plays a central role in the orchestration of cellular processes. The use of inducible promoters to change the expression level of a gene from its physiological level has significantly contributed to the understanding of the functioning of regulatory networks. However, from a quantitative point of view, their use is limited to short-term, population-scale studies to average out cell-to-cell variability and gene expression noise and limit the nonpredictable effects of internal feedback loops that may antagonize the inducer action. Here, we show that, by implementing an external feedback loop, one can tightly control the expression of a gene over many cell generations with quantitative accuracy. To reach this goal, we developed a platform for real-time, closed-loop control of gene expression in yeast that integrates microscopy for monitoring gene expression at the cell level, microfluidics to manipulate the cells' environment, and original software for automated imaging, quantification, and model predictive control. By using an endogenous osmostress responsive promoter and playing with the osmolarity of the cells environment, we show that long-term control can, indeed, be achieved for both time-constant and time-varying target profiles at the population and even the single-cell levels. Importantly, we provide evidence that real-time control can dynamically limit the effects of gene expression stochasticity. We anticipate that our method will be useful to quantitatively probe the dynamic properties of cellular processes and drive complex, synthetically engineered networks.},

We used this approach to generate accelerated and linearized dynamics, sinusoidal oscillations with desired amplitudes and periods, and a complex waveform, all with unprecedented accuracy and precision. We also combined the function generator with a dual fluorescent protein reporter system, analogous to a dual-channel oscilloscope, to reveal that a synthetic repressible promoter linearly transforms repressor signals with an approximate 7-min delay.

This paper propose an innovative laser manufacturing method by combining pulsed and continuous modes of radiation. Continuous radiations are used for the object-to-build itself, in order to guarantee the requested mechanical properties. Pulsed radiations are used to build the support structures. The resulting support structures have sufficient mechanical properties to withstand the deposition system and to evacuate heat, and are easy to remove from the denser parts. This building method reduces drastically time to market since the same laser can be used in two modes and because pulsed radiation allows very high scanning speed with high power during the building of support structures.},

It also considers the multi-rate nature of the sensors: inertial sensing is sampled at a fast sampling frequency while the sampling frequency of vision is lower. the proposed approach uses a constant linear acceleration model and constant angular velocity model based on quaternions, which yields a non-linear model for states and a linear model in measurement equations. Results show that a significant improvement is obtained on the estimation when fusing both measurements with respect to just vision or just inertial measurements. It is also shown that the proposed system can estimate fast-motions even when vision system fails. Moreover, a study of the influence of the noise covariance is also performed, which aims to select their appropriate values at the tuning process. The setup is an end-effector mounted camera, which allow us to pre-define basic rotational and translational motions for validating results.},

	abstract     = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

Synoptic views of flood extent from radar remote sensing satellites have been acquired for flood events in 1998 and 2000. The three models are calibrated, using floodplain and channel friction as free parameters, against both the observed inundated area and records of downstream discharge. The predictive power of the models calibrated against inundation extent or discharge for one event can thus be measured using independent validation data for the second. The results show that for this reach both the HEC-RAS and TELEMAC-2D models can be calibrated against discharge or inundated area data and give good predictions of inundated area, whereas the LISFLOOD-FP needs to be calibrated against independent inundated area data to produce acceptable results. The different predictive performances of the models stem from their different responses to changes in friction parameterisation.},

Geophysical phenomena, including earthquakes, floods and rainfall, represent a class of nonlinear systems termed chaotic, in which the relationships between variables in a system are dynamic and disproportionate, however completely deterministic. Chaos theory provides a structured explanation for irregular behavior and anomalies in systems that are not inherently stochastic. While nonlinear approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks, Hidden Markov Models and Nonlinear Prediction are useful in forecasting of daily discharge values in a river, the focus of these approaches is on forecasting magnitudes of future discharge values rather than the prediction of floods. The described Time Series Data Mining methodology focuses on the prediction of events where floods constitute the events in a river daily discharge time series. The methodology is demonstrated using data collected at the St. Louis gauging station located on the Mississippi River in the USA. Results associated with the impact of earliness of prediction and the acceptable risk-level vs. prediction accuracy are presented.},

This article facilitates the use of these compensators by providing explicit formulas that relate the parameters of the compensators to features of their frequency responses. Two examples illustrate the utility of these compensators for system modeling and controller design. While the examples involve low-order plants, the principles of employing the complex lead and lag compensators remain the same for higher-order systems. We plan to use these compensators as weighting functions with automated robust design tools. A weighting function is a transfer function whose frequency response magnitude is used to bound closed-loop response or modeling uncertainty. The complex lead and lag compensators provide new degree of freedom for selecting weighting functions. In particular, the steep magnitude slope in the transition region of these compensators more closely approximates an ideal step function than weighting functions appearing in the literature (Packard et al.)},

Approximate analyses are presented for both schemes and the results are found useful for the selection of the design parameters. Simulations are given which demonstrate the validity of the analytical results and the ability of the algorithms to reject sinusoidal disturbances with unknown frequency.

Both positive and negative polarity ({\textquotedblleft}on{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}off{\textquotedblright}) enhanced IR imagery is then combined with the enhanced visible imagery to create two single-opponent color-contrast grayscale images. The opponent processed visible and opponent-color images (forming a set of three grayscale images) are then assigned directly to the red, green, blue (RGB) color space. Final manipulation of both hue and saturation is achieved in the hue, saturation, value (HSV) color space. Remarkably realistic color renderings of night scenes are obtained which may support perceptual {\textquotedblleft}pop-out{\textquotedblright} of extended navigation cues and compact targets. Psychophysical testing on low contrast targets in natural dynamic scenes is called for in order to assess human performance using fused visible and IR imagery at night.

Given a family of pre-designed stabilizing controllers, a supervisory unit infers in real-time the potential behavior of each candidate controller and selects the one providing the best potential performance. To this aim, a set of test functionals is defined, which is shown to enjoy favorable inference properties under certain assumptions on the nature of the disturbances. Both persistent-memory and finite-memory test functionals are analyzed. Further, an implementation of the switching controller is proposed which always guarantees stability of the feedback loop, even if the disturbance characteristics are such that the switching is persistent.

	abstract     = {This paper describes the performance characteristics of the LMS adaptive filter, a digital filter composed of a tapped delay line and adjustable weights, whose impulse response is controlled by an adaptive algorithm. For stationary stochastic inputs, the mean-square error, the difference between the filter output and an externally supplied input called the "desired response," is a quadratic function of the weights, a paraboloid with a single fixed minimum point that can be sought by gradient techniques. The gradient estimation process is shown to introduce noise into the weight vector that is proportional to the speed of adaptation and number of weights. The effect of this noise is expressed in terms of a dimensionless quantity "misadjustment" that is a measure of the deviation from optimal Wiener performance. Analysis of a simple nonstationary case, in which the minimum point of the error surface is moving according to an assumed first-order Markov process, shows that an additional contribution to misadjustment arises from "lag" of the adaptive process in tracking the moving minimum point. This contribution, which is additive, is proportional to the number of weights but inversely proportional to the speed of adaptation. The sum of the misadjustments can be minimized by choosing the speed of adaptation to make equal the two contributions. It is further shown, in Appendix A, that for stationary inputs the LMS adaptive algorithm, based on the method of steepest descent, approaches the theoretical limit of efficiency in terms of misadjustment and speed of adaptation when the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix are equal or close in value. When the eigenvalues are highly disparate (\ensuremath{\lambda}max/\ensuremath{\lambda}min\ensuremath{>} 10), an algorithm similar to LMS but based on Newton's method would approach this theoretical limit very closely.},

Once the disturbance is detected, the frequency of the disturbance is identified by the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm.

Remarkably, this equivalent feedback depends only on the ILC operators and hence requires no plant knowledge. This equivalence is obtained whether or not the ILC includes current-cycle feedback. If the ILC system is internally stable and converges to zero error, there exists an internally stabilizing feedback that approaches zero error at high gain. Since conventional feedback requires no iterations, there is no reason to use causal ILC.},

	abstract     = {This paper presents a method for the frequency domain design of infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters. The proposed method designs filters approximating prescribed magnitude and phase responses. IIR filters of this kind can have approximately linear-phase responses in their passbands, or they can equalize magnitude and phase responses of given systems. In many cases, these filters can be implemented with less memory and with fewer computations per output sample than equivalent finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters. An important feature of the proposed method is the possibility to specify a maximum radius for the poles of the designed rational transfer function. Consequently, stability can be guaranteed, and undesired effects of implementations using fixed-point arithmetic can be alleviated by restricting the poles to keep a prescribed distance from the unit circle. This is achieved by applying Rouche's theorem in the proposed design algorithm. We motivate the use of IIR filters with an unequal number of poles and zeros outside the origin of the complex plane. In order to satisfy simultaneous specifications on magnitude and phase responses, it is advantageous to use IIR filters with only a few poles outside the origin of the z-plane and an arbitrary number of zeros. Filters of this type are a compromise between IIR filters with optimum magnitude responses and phase-approximating FIR filters. We use design examples to compare filters designed by the proposed method to those obtained by other methods. In addition, we compare the proposed general IIR filters with other popular more specialized structures such as FIR filters and cascaded systems consisting of frequency-selective IIR filters and phase-equalizing allpass filters},

The National Weather Service's (NWS) WSR-88D radar (NEXRAD) was used to estimate the areal and spatial distribution of rainfall for three storms over the Brays Bayou watershed in Houston for hydrologic modeling purposes. Rainfall rates estimated from the NEXRAD radar compared favorably to the point rainfall measurements at the operating rain gauges in the watershed for the large October 1994 storm, but tended to overpredict the point rainfall measurements at the rain gauges for two smaller events. Using HEC-1, two model runs were made using the unadjusted NEXRAD-estimated rainfall rates and also using the rain gauge network, and the modeled outflow hydrographs were compared to the measured hydrograph for all three storms. The results from the radar proved to be as accurate, and in some cases more accurate, than the rain gauge model when predicting runoff volume, peak flow, and time of peak. Results from this research are being used to create a local flood warning system on the Brays Bayou watershed using real-time NEXRAD radar.},

	abstract     = {New manufacturing methods are being sought for electronics production. Printable electronics is a promising method for producing low cost and large-scale electronics. In printable electronics nanoparticle inks printed on the surface of substrate contain additives, such as dispersing agent and carrier fluids that provide good printing properties by changing the viscosity and separating the nanoparticles of the ink. In the sintering process ink particles are heated to a certain, ink-specific temperature. During the sintering process the carrier fluid and dispersing agents are evaporated from the ink. Additional heating after evaporation causes the nanoparticles to start to agglomerate. A small particle size allows the use of a considerably lower sintering temperature than with bulk silver, for example 220 {\textdegree}C. The sintering process is usually utilized with a convection oven, with a long sintering time, and the thermal load on the surrounding material can become too great as components and patterns are formed from layers of different type inks. Hence, alternative sintering methods are sought. This paper describes tests done with two different types of laser; pulsed and continuous wave lasers. Laser sintering enables short sintering times and selective sintering, making it possible for printed structures to contain fragile active components produced with other technologies.},

The first stage simultaneously classifies the data points and estimates the number of submodels and the corresponding parameters by solving the partition into a minimum number of feasible subsystems (MIN PFS) problem for a suitable set of linear complementary inequalities derived from data. Second, a refinement procedure reduces misclassifications and improves parameter estimates. The third stage determines a polyhedral partition of the regressor set via two-class or multiclass linear separation techniques. As a main feature, the algorithm imposes that the identification error is bounded by a quantity delta;. Such a bound is a useful tuning parameter to trade off between quality of fit and model complexity. The performance of the proposed PWA system identification procedure is demonstrated via numerical examples and on experimental data from an electronic component placement process in a pick-and-place machine.},

Based on the wave theory and Morison equation, an exosystem is designed to describe the irregular wave forces. Through a particular transformation, the original delay system is reduced into a non-delay system. Based on the reduced system, the paper develops a feedforward and feedback optimal control law with memory (FFOCLM). The memory terms in FFOCLM compensate the time-delay in control input. The feedforward term of the controller includes the information of the irregular wave forces. The feedback loop incorporates the displacement and velocity of structure into the control law. The FFOCLM is proved to be existent and unique, and able to stabilize the time-delay system. The feasibility and effectiveness of the presented control law is demonstrated by a numerical example of a jacket-type offshore structure.},
